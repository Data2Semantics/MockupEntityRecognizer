<body>   1  Introduction  Febrile neutropenic patients are at increased risk of complications from infections because of immunosupression . Current guidelines recommend the early (less than 1 hour) initiation of antibiotics for patients with severe sepsis because of epidemiologic data demonstrating that delays are associated with increased mortality . Although simple in principle, actually achieving high levels of compliance with early antibiotic administration can be a great challenge, as exemplified by the lack of increase in the broad-spectrum antibiotic component of the resuscitation bundle of the surviving sepsis guidelines after an education program . Early administration of antibiotics has been proposed as a quality indicator for oncologic hospitals caring for febrile neutropenic patients .  Previous work has focused on critical pathways , education, and reducing cost constraints on antibiotics use , tackling multiple points in the process of antibiotic delivery at the same time. Our hospital frequently admits children with febrile neutropenia, providing us with an opportunity to study different aspects of antibiotic administration in this population. In our hospital, children with febrile neutropenia are typically admitted directly to a pediatric step-down critical care unit, after a phone call from the referring physician to the intensivist. This setting decreases time spent waiting in the emergency room, and gives the receiving intensive care unit (ICU) team more time to organize and plan treatments for the patient. Therefore, we were able to study delays in antibiotic delivery that are not related to time to diagnosis or misdiagnosis or access to emergency room physician. Our main objective was to determine whether a simple quality improvement intervention, leaving the first dose of broad-spectrum antibiotics available in the emergency cart, decreased the time to delivery of antibiotics and reduced medical complications in pediatric oncologic patients with febrile neutropenia.    2  Methods  We conducted an observational study to examine antibiotic administration, before and after the institution of the quality improvement intervention, in oncologic patients diagnosed with febrile neutropenia (fever and neutrophil count &amp;lt;500 cells/mm  3  or undergoing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration for neutropenia) and hospitalized in the pediatric ICU of Hospital Brasília. The intervention was to maintain one dose of broad-spectrum antibiotics available in the emergency cart in the ICU. This was proposed by the ICU team as an intervention to reduce the delay in antibiotic delivery because it was felt to be the most important barrier, since previously, a central pharmacy needed to be reached for the antibiotics. No specific education or protocol for early antibiotics was introduced at this moment.  Patients meeting inclusion criteria were identified using the Hospital database. We included patients (age ≤18 years) undergoing chemotherapy who were admitted in the pediatric ICU with fever related to an infection as a major diagnostic category and who had cancer-related neutropenia (we allowed for patients who were not neutropenic at ICU admission but who were recently started on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for neutropenia). We excluded patients with incomplete data, those who were transferred from another ICU, or those who were already using antibiotics and admitted to the ICU without a change in their therapy.  We estimated that 25 patients from each period (before and after) would be required to detect a reduction in antibiotic delivery time from 150 to 60 minutes, considering a power of 0.8 and  α  of .05, based on a sample of 10 patients (not included in the study) who had a median antibiotic delivery time of 150 minutes.  We collected data on 50 consecutive patients who were admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia (25 during each period: before the intervention, from April 2006 to April 2007 and after, from May 2007 to May 2008). One patient in the preintervention group and 4 in the post-intervention group were excluded because neutropenia was congenital. We used a standardized data collection form to register patient's data: date of birth, sex, date and time of admission, oncologic diagnoses, date of last chemotherapy, surgery in the last 3 months, use of central venous catheter, use of antibiotic and/or antifungal prophylaxis, neutrophil count, period of hospitalization, last febrile date, time of antibiotic administration, antibiotic use in the first 24 hours and in the first 72 hours, results of cultures, date of hospital discharge, need for hemodialysis, mechanical ventilation use, and vasoactive drug use. Time of antibiotic delivery was recorded as the time of the day that was recorded in the patient's chart. This note is charted by nurses immediately after the first administration. There is no electronic record for time of administration and there was no change in the process of charting between the 2 periods. Time to antibiotic delivery was calculated as the time delivered minus the hour of ICU admission (which includes minutes) because these patients are admitted directly to the ICU.  The software SPSS 16.0 was used for statistical analysis. Data was analyzed with Fisher exact test for proportions and  t  test or Mann-Whitney  U  test for continuous variables, as appropriate. Time to antibiotic administration is also plotted as a Kaplan-Meier curve, with log-rank statistics. A bicaudal  P  value of less than .05 was considered significant.  This study was approved by the ethics committee of the College of Medicine of University of Brasília, which waived the need for informed consent from individual patients.    3  Results  Data from 50 patients were reviewed, 25 before (preintervention period, from April 2006 to April 2007) and 25 after intervention (postintervention period, from May 2007 to May 2008). Five patients (1 before and 4 after the intervention) were excluded because their neutropenia was related to a congenital disease. There were no patients who died before receiving antibiotics or who never received antibiotics for febrile neutropenia.  Patients admitted during the postintervention period tended to be younger (mean age 7.4 vs 5.0,  P  &amp;lt; .001). Hematologic cancers were the most common underlying malignancy during both periods. A source of infection was identified in 2 patients in the preintervention period (sinusitis and catheter infection) and in 1 patient in the postintervention period (sinusitis). Cefepime and vancomycin were the most commonly used antibiotics during both periods (  ).  Time to antibiotic delivery was significantly reduced in the postintervention period, from median 164 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 108-172 minutes) to median 55 minutes (IQR, 18-225 minutes) (). Kaplan-Meier curves are shown in  . The proportion of patients receiving antibiotics in less than 60 minutes increased from 0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-14%) in the preintervention period to 52% (95% CI, 30%-74%;  P  &amp;lt; .001) in the post-intervention period.  No patient required central venous catheters, hemodialysis, mechanical ventilation, or vasopressors.    4  Discussion  This article demonstrates how overcoming a simple barrier can have a dramatic effect on quality of care. This quality improvement intervention, leaving the first dose of broad-spectrum antibiotics available in the emergency cart, did not require additional costs or complex multiprofessional efforts, and reduced time to antibiotic delivery in pediatric febrile oncologic patients. An important aspect of this result is that the costs of this quality improvement project are irrelevant compared with the costs involved in assembling multiprofessional teams to educate staff or to elaborate a new protocol. It is also faster and easier to be implemented. Educational actions usually consume time for team training and additional money for material related to protocol divulgation, and even then can still have a low compliance with the process .  We postulate that quality improvement projects should not focus only on education and training but rather on trying to understand the entire process and focus on the couple of crucial steps where interventions are most likely to bring consistent results. Unless there must be higher level considerations in the decisions, most interventions should be directed to changing the system. Various strategies may be used to help health care workers achieve better performance; whereas ours aimed at reducing barriers to access, other possibilities exist, such as forcing functions (eg, patients with a diagnosis of febrile neutropenia can only be admitted to the ICU if there is an order for antibiotics), or default situations, where the health care worker is guided to use the most recommended action  (eg, with computerized order entries, making the default in the ICU that every antibiotic has an immediate start) while not restricting his options (the time to antibiotic initiation can still be changed in the computer).  Our study has several limitations. Although the sample size was appropriate to demonstrate a difference, it is important to keep in mind that this is still a study that is subject to statistical fragility, where small changes in numerator and denominator could eliminate the observed statistical significance, possibly limiting its generalization. The pre- and postintervention design of this study may be biased toward a positive result because of ecologic trends in delivering antibiotics faster, based on literature recommendations . However, we consider this to be less likely because the change occurred over a very short period, and the push forward decreasing antibiotic delivery time was already happening, even at the time of our pre intervention assessment. Another consideration could be a Hawthorne effect, where time to antibiotic delivery could have been decreasing because of house staff being observed during the study . However, there was only one subject in the unit who knew about the study; there were no external subjects observing the actions (all data were chart abstracted after patients' discharge). Benefits of earlier institution of antibiotic therapy in terms of mortality is clear in septic shock patients, where every hour of delay after hypotension was associated with a survival drop of 7.6%, in average, during the first 6 hours . It is not clear if the benefits can be extrapolated to other groups of patients, as in oncologic febrile patients, but there is a tendency to expand this concept of earlier administration of antibiotics to them. Although we could not demonstrate any clinical benefits in our population, due to this study being underpowered to detect clinical differences, its main objective was to demonstrate the effectiveness of improving process of care, not outcomes.  Our results suggest that simple interventions can reduce time to antibiotic administration in a selected group of patients in a pediatric ICU. The appropriate validation of these findings would require a cluster randomized trial, but the minimal costs involved in providing broad-spectrum antibiotics in the emergency cart outweigh the large costs involved in such a trial.   </body>
