<body>  Neutropenia is often an inevitable part of treating hematologic malignancies. It is the most common cause of limiting the dose of chemotherapy and if neutropenia occurs, it puts a patient at a much higher risk of developing an infection that can quickly become life threatening. As such, it is a goal for nurses to prevent neutropenic infections as much as possible. Because the first sign, and often only sign, of a neutropenic infection is fever, oncology staff use a fever as an objective measure to gauge the health status of the patient. In the past, common nursing interventions used to prevent neutropenic fever have included protective isolation and neutropenic diet. However, there is little data to support the use of either. In addition, these measures are difficult to adhere to and create a feeling of isolation in the patient. The purpose of this review of literature is to critically analyze current literature to determine if there are data that indicate that neutropenic diet and protective isolation are effective forms of preventing neutropenic fever. CINAHL, MEDLINE and the Cochrane database were searched for key words “neutropenia”, “fever”, “infection”, “prevention”, “isolation”, and “diet”, with a time limitation from 2001 until present. Additional articles were identified from the reference lists of these articles. Twelve articles were identified as being pertinent to the subject matter. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were included in the review. The data found in the literature review does not support the use of neutropenic diet or reverse isolation for the prevention of neutropenic fever. Instead of using resources and time on these interventions, nurses should emphasize that patients employ proper hand hygiene and that fruits and vegetables are thoroughly washed before eating them.  </body>
