<body>   1  Introduction  Infection is still a frequent and serious problem in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy who then become neutropenic. Despite major advances in the therapy of febrile neutropenia (FN), including more effective and less toxic empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics that can be used as outpatient therapy in selected low-risk patients, availability of better empirical antifungal regimens in patients who do not respond to standard antibiotics and increased use of standard and long-acting granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, FN still remains a very difficult therapeutic problem with a significant mortality rate. The most severe bacterial infections in these patients are bloodstream infections (bacteraemia) with or without a site of primary infection.  Factors predictive of bacteraemia in patients with FN have been studied in the past  but the model developed was not very helpful. Bacteraemia during FN has mostly been studied in patients with haematological malignancies, especially those receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplants . The present-day situation for bacteraemia in the FN population is the subject of this manuscript.  Bacteraemia rates in large trials testing empirical treatments for FN remain high, as evidenced by a recent co-operative group publication by Viscoli et al.  in which 29% of FN episodes were associated with bacteraemia. In that study, the pathogens causing bacteraemia were approximately equally divided among Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Mortality in patients with bacteraemia is high, especially when a clinical site of infection is identified , which is designated as ‘complex bacteraemia’. Although bacteraemia rates may be a little lower, they are still frequent. The Infectious Diseases Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC-IDG) trials had a 32% rate of bacteraemia in 1973, which dropped to 22% in 1994 . However, their experience was that the proportion of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens causing bacteraemia changed over this time period. The proportion of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens went from 71% and 29%, respectively, in 1973–1978 to 33% and 67%, respectively, in 1992–1994. This observation has been confirmed by others .  The reason for the increase in Gram-positive pathogens is probably multifactorial. The main theoretical cause is the increased use of prophylactic antibiotics such as the fluoroquinolones , which tend to lower the number of Gram-negative pathogens, thus the proportion of Gram-positive pathogens may then increase. Other possible causes include the increased use of central venous catheters in these patients, the chosen chemotherapy which may cause significant mucositis, and the increased use of antacids, which may all select for Gram-positive microorganisms. This change has mainly been seen in developed countries that can better afford prophylactic antibiotics and the use of central catheters, which will be discussed further.  The main Gram-negative organisms isolated that cause bacteraemia remain  Escherichia coli ,  Klebsiella  sp. and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , as has been the pattern for many years. Other Gram-negative organisms are also seen but far less often. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) remain the main Gram-positive pathogens causing bacteraemia, but again a variety of other Gram-positive organisms are also isolated less frequently.  A few selected recent publications describing series of patients with FN will be reviewed to see whether the epidemiology and outcomes of treatment are changing and at the same time to see whether there are any good methods to predict which patients with FN will develop bacteraemia. We may then be able to develop new approaches to improve the results of therapy in this seriously ill patient population.    2  Selected recent series of patients with cancer and FN caused by chemotherapy  A very large study was recently published by Klastersky et al.  that combined data from two sequential observational studies involving cancer patients with FN treated at many centres throughout the world carried out by the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC). The purpose of the first study (which included 1139 eligible patients with FN seen between October 1994 and October 1997) was to separate out the characteristics of patients whose FN could be treated as outpatients and who were at low risk of developing complications or dying of their infectious episode. The general data from this study have already been published  and were used to develop the MASCC risk index, which has been validated and well-accepted worldwide and is quoted by the most recently published FN guidelines  of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).  The purpose of the second survey was the validation of the prognostic index derived from the first study of 1139 patients and the construction of a model to predict the time to neutrophil recovery at the onset of an episode of FN in order to help improve treatment strategies in the future. Data from 1003 eligible patients in this study were collected as part of this so far unpublished study between November 1997 and February 2005. Data from the total of 2142 patients formed the basis for the present study . The focus of this recently published manuscript was on the patients who developed bacteraemia (499 in total, with 293 from the first study  and 206 from the second as yet unpublished study). The authors stated they were trying to find factors that predicted bacteraemia and other severe complications of FN at the time the patient first presents with fever, which might lead to better outcomes in these patients. Standard definitions for bacteraemia and severe complications were used.  A number of interesting results came from this study. The median age of the population was 52 years and the male/female ratio was close to 1. Although there were more patients with haematological malignancies (1223) compared with solid tumours (919), the ratio was approximately 1/1 in non-bacteraemic patients but was 2.7/1 in patients with bacteraemia ( P  &amp;lt; 0.001). The mortality rate was 9% in patients with haematological cancers and 13% in those with solid tumours when bacteraemia was documented ( P  &amp;lt; 0.001), compared with 4% and 3%, respectively, in non-bacteraemic patients. Mortality was lower in bone marrow transplants (3%) than other haematological patients (6%), which was statistically significant ( P  = 0.04). Mortality was higher in patients with a clinical site of infection in non-bacteraemic patients (4% vs. 3%), but was 12% vs. 8% in bacteraemic patients, although the differences were not statistically significant.  There were 168 patients (34%) with bacteraemia caused by a single Gram-negative organism. The mortality observed was 18%, 10% and 31% when the bacteraemia was caused  by E. coli ,  Klebsiella  sp. and  P. aeruginosa , respectively. Eighty-two (49%) had complex bacteraemia (a site of infection present). Among the 283 episodes with bacteraemia due to a single Gram-positive pathogen, there was a 5% mortality rate, which was significantly lower than the 18% mortality in bacteraemia caused by a single Gram-negative organism ( P  &amp;lt; 0.001). CoNS were the most frequent Gram-positive pathogens causing bacteraemia (50%) and were associated with a mortality rate of 5%. A mortality rate of 4% was noted among the 73 streptococcal bacteraemias. A clinical site for infection was identified in 45% of Gram-positive bacteraemias (complex bacteraemia). There were 48 polymicrobial bacteraemias, with a 13% mortality rate. Only 1/19 of these patients died of these bacteraemias if there were mixtures of Gram-positive pathogens with no Gram-negatives at all, compared with 5/29 (17%) if at least one Gram-negative pathogen was present.  The authors also examined the possible effects of the administration of prophylactic antibiotics or granulopoiesis-stimulating factors on their data. The use of prophylactic antibiotics affected the type of pathogen causing bacteraemia, with only 25% caused by Gram-negative organisms compared with 75% caused by Gram-positive organisms; if no prophylactic antibiotics were given the rates were 52% and 48%, respectively ( P  &amp;lt; 0.001). There did not appear to be any effect on the type of pathogen when granulopoiesis agents were administered. These observations may be influenced by the fact that only 119 patients received granulopoiesis agents, whilst many more patients (278) received prophylactic antibiotics. The administration of either antibiotics or granulopoiesis-stimulating factors did not affect mortality or overall complication rates.  The authors looked at the possible importance of the MASCC score at the beginning of FN in relation to bacteraemia. The MASCC scoring system is shown in  . A relatively low rate of overall complications (18%) and death (3%) was seen in low-risk patients with bacteraemia and MASCC scores of &amp;gt;21, but if the MASCC score was &amp;lt;21 the corresponding figures were 49% and 19% (  P  &amp;lt; 0.001). If the score was &amp;lt;15, overall complications (79%) and mortality (36%) were even higher, with 15–20 being intermediate in risk (40% and 14%, respectively). This is a very interesting observation that requires confirmation. Using this score one can definitely identify low-risk and high-risk patients with bacteraemia, and perhaps a different approach to therapy is required in the high-risk patients to try to lower the very high overall complication and mortality rates seen in these patients (MASCC score &amp;lt;15). They also found that even with Gram-positive bacteraemia, a low MASCC score (&amp;lt;15) predicts a very high mortality (28%). These data are not ideal because the number of very high-risk patients in this study (MASCC score &amp;lt;15) was quite small (47). However, the data still suggest that patients with low MASCC scores and bacteraemia have a poor prognosis and may require a different therapeutic approach.  In developing countries we may see a different situation. The predominant pathogens causing bacteraemia are frequently Gram-negative because they cannot afford to give routinely prophylactic oral antibiotics, such as quinolones, and cannot afford to use so many central lines, with both of these approaches contributing to the emergence of Gram-positive organisms causing bacteraemia in developed countries. We will look at two examples of recently published manuscripts with data on this group of patients in developing countries.  Kanafani et al.  have recently published their experience with FN from a hospital in Lebanon and included data on bacteraemia. This study was conducted between January 2001 and December 2003 at The American University of Beirut Medical Center, a 400-bed teaching hospital. A total of 177 episodes of FN were identified in 116 patients; 42% of these patients had malignant lymphoma, 35% had acute leukaemia and 16% had solid tumours. Thirty-two cases (18%) had been given prophylactic antibiotics. The mean duration of neutropenia in these cases was 7.2 days. Clinically documented (46.9%) and microbiologically documented (29.4%) infections made up the majority of the FN episodes. Thirty-three (18.6%) of the episodes were bacteraemia, compared with bacteraemia rates of 30% in 1999 and 28.8% in 1995–1998 at the same centre. Gram-negative pathogens predominated (26/33) as causative agents for bacteraemia in the most recent series. Among the Gram-negative pathogens, E. coli  and  P. aeruginosa  were the most frequent. CoNS were the predominant Gram-positive pathogens. There were five episodes of polymicrobial bacteraemia (not seen at all in the previous two series). The assumption is that the Gram-negative pathogens were most common due to the lack of central lines and the low frequency of administration of prophylactic antibiotics, as previously discussed. The in-hospital mortality rate for all episodes of FN improved compared with the previous series from this centre (12.1% vs. 20%). The specific data on mortality with bacteraemia are not given.  Another study from Malaysia was recently published by Baskaran et al. . It was a retrospective study of patients admitted with FN seen from 1 January 2004 to 31 January 2005 at a university medical centre. There were 120 episodes, of which 116 were considered evaluable. The patient population included 52% with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 27.6% with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; most of the patients (83.6%) had active disease. A total of 78 patients (67.2%) were given primary chemotherapy and another 10 patients (8.6%) had haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Three-quarters of the episodes occurred while the patients were still in hospital. Fifty episodes of bacteraemia were found in a total of 37 patients. Thirty-five episodes of bacteraemia had a single pathogen, 10 episodes had two pathogens isolated and in the remaining 5 episodes three or more pathogens were isolated. Like the previous series from Lebanon the majority (44/73) of pathogens were Gram-negative organisms. Enterobacteriaceae were the most frequently isolated Gram-negative organisms, whilst CoNS were again the most common Gram-positive organisms, as noted in the previous series. Gram-negative bacteraemia was present in 35.5% of all patients with AML compared with only 8.6% of those with lymphoma ( P  = 0.03). The incidence of Gram-positive bacteraemia in the AML patients was also increased at 27.6% vs. 14.3% in the lymphoma patients ( P  = 0.123). Gram-negative bacteraemia was more common in patients with severe neutropenia (&amp;lt;100 cells/mm 3 ) (37% vs. 19% in those with a neutrophil count &amp;gt;100  cells/mm 3 ;  P  = 0.03). There were 13 patients taking prophylactic antibiotics (5 developed bacteraemia, most (3/5) of which were caused by resistant organisms). Line infections comprised 23.3% of the infections (5/12 had Gram-negative bacteraemia, whilst 4 had Gram-positive bacteraemia and 3 were mixed). Therefore, no obvious predisposition to Gram-positive infections was noted in the patients with line infections. These data are very similar to the previous study. Perhaps Gram-negative pathogens may be returning (possibly also in developed countries) without any clear explanation.    3  Markers used to predict bacteraemia in patients with FN  Vekemans et al.  recently looked at the value of low mannose-binding lectin (MBL) concentrations as a possible indicator of severe infections in patients with haematological malignancies based on preliminary encouraging data from other studies. A large number of patients (282) were involved in this study, with 62 (24%) of 255 eligible patients being MBL deficient. This study did not reveal a difference in the ratio of the duration of FN to the number of days of neutropenia (their primary objective). However, a higher risk of severe infections (including bacteraemia) was noted if the patients were receiving chemotherapy and had a low MBL and it also occurred earlier in patients with a low MBL (10 days vs. 21 days;  P  = 0.05). Multivariate analysis was performed to rule out other factors that might increase the rate of severe infections. Bacteraemia developed earlier in the MBL-deficient group ( P  = 0.02), as did other serious infections. These data are encouraging but not all the data on this marker are as positive as in this study.  In 2007, Schlapbach et al.  looked at this marker in a neutropenic paediatric population. They studied 177 episodes of FN in 94 patients and observed more frequent episodes of FN in children both with normal levels of MBL and with very low levels, but only with very low levels was bacteraemia more likely to be present. These results are somewhat confusing and hard to interpret, making it necessary to obtain results from other ongoing and planned studies both in adult and paediatric cancer populations. Additional data may help us to decide on the real value of this interesting and potentially useful marker.  Other laboratory markers such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and procalcitonin (PCT) have been used and are probably superior to C-reactive protein (CRP), as is made clear in a recent review by Kern . IL-8 appears to be very specific in some studies. A low level at fever onset may virtually eliminate the possibility of Gram-negative bacteraemia. A recent publication by Diepold et al.  compares IL-6, IL-8 and CRP in 123 evaluable episodes of FN in a paediatric population with malignancy. They also tried to see whether these markers predict for a low risk of severe infection or bacteraemia, and low levels of IL-6 at the onset of fever appeared to be superior to the other markers in this regard. A low level of PCT (0.5 ng/mL) may also help in this prediction. However, all these markers still need further testing, but if these findings are confirmed they may become part of the standard work-up in FN.  As previously discussed, the MASCC risk index could also be very useful if the predictive value of low MASCC scores for the development of FN, especially bacteraemia, is confirmed in other studies. Perhaps the MASCC score and the predictive laboratory markers can be combined in some yet to be developed index to give an even better idea of which patients will likely develop bacteraemia. We then need to decide how to treat patients with a low MASCC risk index and those with abnormal laboratory markers differently than we do now in order to potentially lower the overall morbidity and mortality from serious infections, particularly Gram-negative bacteraemia.    4  Conclusions  Bloodstream infections (bacteraemia) in FN in the developed world used to be caused primarily by Gram-negative organisms, but in the last 10–15 years this has changed to predominately Gram-positive pathogens, especially CoNS. This may be reversing again, especially in some countries in Europe where Gram-negative pathogens may be making a comeback. In developing countries we still see mainly Gram-negative organisms, perhaps due to their less frequent use of central lines and prophylactic antibiotics for cost-containment reasons. Gram-negative bacteraemia is still common and is associated with high overall morbidity and mortality, especially when accompanied by an identified focus of infection (complex bacteraemia). A low MASCC risk index (&amp;lt;15) may predict for a higher risk of developing bacteraemia and a generally poorer outcome after treatment. This must be confirmed in other clinical trials. Laboratory markers such as MBL, IL-6, IL-8 and PCT may also help to predict which patients with FN will develop bacteraemia, but further studies testing this hypothesis are required before they can be used routinely in FN. Perhaps the laboratory markers and low MASSC score need to be combined to predict this event better. The challenge is then to find new and hopefully better ways to treat bloodstream infections in order to lower their known high overall morbidity and mortality. Ideally, we should probably start the new treatments when the markers are first indicative of a higher than expected potential for bacteraemia, at the time the patient first becomes febrile.

<allsmall> Bloodstream infections in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia    Abstract   Bloodstream infections (bacteraemia) account for approximately 25–30% of febrile episodes in patients with febrile neutropenia (FN). In developed countries, Gram-positive pathogens predominate. Mortality is higher in Gram-negative bacteraemia. A recent study involving 2142 patients with FN was reviewed, including 168 patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia (mortality 18%), 283 patients with Gram-positive bacteraemia (mortality 5%) and 48 patients with polymicrobial bacteraemia (mortality 13%). Among patients who received prophylactic antibiotics, Gram-positive bacteraemia was far more common than Gram-negative bacteraemia (75% vs. 25%), compared with approximately 50% of each in patients without prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with a Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score &amp;lt;15 had a 36% mortality compared with 3% if the MASCC score was &amp;gt;21. The MASCC score may help risk stratification of patients with FN and bacteraemia, although these data require confirmation. In two series of patients from developing countries (Lebanon and Malaysia), Gram-negative bacteraemia was more common and mortality was higher. In developing countries, Gram-negative bacteraemia may be more frequent due to less use of prophylactic antibiotics and central lines. Laboratory markers may have predictive and prognostic value for bacteraemia in patients at the onset of FN, including mannose-binding lectin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and procalcitonin, but further studies are required before they can be recommended. New therapies are required to lower the mortality in patients with FN with a high risk for bacteraemia.    Bacteraemia, Febrile neutropenia, Predictive laboratory markers</allsmall>

New therapies are required to lower the mortality in patients with FN with a high risk for bacteraemia.</medlineabs><medlinesubtype>publication</medlinesubtype><medlinesrctype>Abstract</medlinesrctype><medlineauth>Feld, Ronald</medlineauth><citationsubset>IM</citationsubset><datecreatedtxt>20081223</datecreatedtxt><uniqueid>9111860</uniqueid><mshmajsubject2>complications__|__epidemiology</mshmajsubject2><datecompletedtxt>20090217</datecompletedtxt><medlineitemtitle>Bloodstream infections in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia.</medlineitemtitle><medlineissn>0924-8579</medlineissn><medlinesrctitleabbr>Int.

A recent study involving 2142 patients with FN was reviewed, including 168 patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia (mortality 18%), 283 patients with Gram-positive bacteraemia (mortality 5%) and 48 patients with polymicrobial bacteraemia (mortality 13%). Among patients who received prophylactic antibiotics, Gram-positive bacteraemia was far more common than Gram-negative bacteraemia (75% vs. 25%), compared with approximately 50% of each in patients without prophylactic antibiotics.
