<body>   1  Introduction  DNA repair systems are known to be related to cancer risk and also to the response to anticancer treatments .   XPD  and  XRCC1  genes are located on 19. chromosome and encode XPD ve XRCC1 proteins. XPD protein is a helicase, which is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and basal transcription as part of the transcription factor IIH. The polymorphisms  XPD  Asp312Asn and  XPD  Lys751Gln are associated with increased DNA adduct levels , and with low DNA repair capacity . XRCC1, a DNA repair protein involved in single-strand breaks (SSBs) and base excision repair (BER) pathway, is responsible for the repair of DNA damage caused by active oxygen, ionization, and alkylating agents .  XRCC1  polymorphisms at codons 194 and 399 were found to be associated with cancer risk or carcinogen–DNA adducts.  Febrile neutropenia (FN) is an important toxicity of systemic chemotherapy causing not only morbidity and mortality, but also delays in treatment, and increase in hospitalization and cost. . There are no studies that have examined the relationship between DNA repair enzyme polymorphisms and the severity of neutropenic infections and mucositis in the literature. In this study, we evaluated the possible effect of  XPD  codon (312 and 751) and  XRCC1  codon (194 and 399) single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the risk of FN and mucositis in children under leukemia or lymphoma treatment.    2  Materials and methods   2.1  Study subjects and data collection  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL;  n  = 61) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL;  n  = 29) patients who were followed at Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2007 were recruited in the study. Of the 183 ALL patients, 35 (19%) died before the study and 15 (8%) were unable to be located. The remaining 133 were contacted, of whom 72 refused to participate or did not come during the study period. Thus, 61 patients, who were in complete hematologic remission, were consecutively included between August 2005 and December 2007. The diagnosis of ALL was made by using French–American–British (FAB) criteria after conventional cytochemical and surface-marker analysis. After 1989, BFM (Berlin–Frankfurt–Münster) based therapies were used in all patients with ALL in our unit. Between August 1990 and 2000, modified ALL-BFM 90 protocol was used. The only modification compared to the original protocol was methotrexate (MTX) given 1 g/m 2  over 36 h instead of 5 g/m 2  over 24 h. After January 2000, BFM-TR ALL 2000 trail was used. This was the first Turkish multicentric observation study which was again a modified form of ALL-BFM 95, including the modification of high dose-MTX as 1 g instead of 5 g and addition of prophylactic 12 Gy cranial radiotherapy in medium risk patients. Since 2004, unmodified BFM-95 has been used.  A total of 48 patients younger than 18 years old with newly diagnosed BL were treated in our department between September 1995 and December 2007. Twenty-nine patients with BL who consented to participate were included in the study. The stages of patients were as follows—stage 1: 2 patients, stage 2: 5 patients, stage 3: 14 patients and stage 4: 8 patients. The diagnosis of BL was made by using pathology reports and slides which were reviewed to assign a cell phenotype and code of the WHO (World Health Organization) International Classification of Diseases for Oncology. In our unit, BFM-B cell NHL-95 protocol is used in treating patients with BL since 1995. Patients in risk groups R2, R3, and R4 according to the protocol received a cytoreductive prophase treatment including steroids and cyclophosphamide before the first course of induction treatment. Methotrexate was administered by intravenous infusion over 24 h continuously. The dose of MTX was 1 g/m 2  in courses A and B (risk groups R1, R2), and 5 g/m 2  in courses AA, BB and CC (risk groups R3, R4). Patients received two courses of induction therapy in risk group R1 (resected), four courses in R2 (LDH &amp;lt; 500 U/L), five in R3 (LDH &amp;gt; 500 to &amp;lt;1000  U/L) and six in R4 (LDH &amp;gt; 1000 U/L and/or CNS disease).  Controls ( n  = 99) were selected randomly from age and sex matched healthy children with no prior history of cancer. The 55 males and 44 females in the control group had a mean age of 7.35 ± 4.67 years.  All cases were Turkish children and informed consent was obtained from the participating individuals and/or their parents. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty.    2.2  Febrile neutropenia  All together, 277 (155 in ALL patients and 122 in NHL patients) FN attacks (defined as fever &amp;gt;38.5  °C once, or 38 °C &amp;gt; 1 h with an absolute neutrophil count below 0.5 × 109/l) of 90 patients were analyzed. Febrile neutropenia lasting more than 10 days and occurrence of a severe FN attack defined with a serious localized infection (abscess, invasive fungal infection, typhilitis and pancreatitis) and clinically documented severe mucositis during treatment period were retrospectively analyzed from patient files.    2.3  Blood samples and DNA isolation  Venous blood samples were obtained from patient and control groups and collected into EDTA tubes. Immediately after collection, whole blood was stored in aliquots at −20  °C until use. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using Roche DNA purification kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).    2.4  Genotyping of XPD codons 312, 751 and XRCC1 codons 194 and 399   XRCC1  Arg399Gln (rs25487),  XRCC1  Arg194Trp (rs1799782),  XPD  Asp312Asn (rs1799793) and  XPD  Lys751Gln (rs13181) genotypes were determined by using polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) methods as previously described.    2.5  Statistical analysis  Mean and standard deviations (SD) were presented in case of continuous variables. Differences between the means of the two continuous variables were evaluated by the Student&apos;s t -test. Chi-square or Fischer&apos;s exact test (two-sided) was used to compare the gender distribution, test the association between the genotypes and alleles in relation to the cases and controls, and test for deviation of genotype distribution from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). p -Values of &amp;lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. The odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the strength of the association between polymorphism genotype alleles in patients and controls. Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 13.0.     3  Results  The demographic data of cases and controls is shown in  . The polymorphisms in  XPD  and  XRCC1  genes (genotypic and allelic distributions) of both cases and controls are shown in  . All observed polymorphisms were in agreement with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. No statistically significant differences were observed in the allele or genotype frequencies of the XPD  Asp312Asn,  XPD  Lys751Gln,  XRCC1  Arg194Trp, and  XRCC1  Arg399Gln polymorphisms between the controls and patients.    shows the gene polymorphisms of patients in relation to different FN variables. Because of the rarity of cases with Trp/Trp genotype for  XRCC1  Arg194Trp polymorphism; patients with Trp/Trp genotype were analyzed with patients with Arg/Trp genotype for  XRCC1  Arg194Trp polymorphism.  When the different polymorphisms were compared subgroup analysis revealed that  XRCC1  194Trp allele showed a protective effect against longer FN attacks (OR = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.08–0.81; p  = 0.01) and mucositis ( p  = 0.0001).   XRCC1  Arg399 Gln polymorphism was found to be a risk factor for severe mucositis (OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.09–3.37; p  = 0.02). No association was found between febrile neutropenia and/or mucositis in other  XRCC1  gene polymorphisms and  XPD  polymorphisms.    4  Discussion  Inherited mutations in DNA repair genes can cause an individual to have exceptionally high risk for the development of cancer. Xeroderma pigmentosum, Fanconi anemia, and ataxia telangiectasia diseases, caused by inherited mutations in DNA repair genes, were documented examples of genetic predisposition to cancer. DNA repair disorders are also primary immunodeficiency syndromes that lead to recurrent infections . Ataxia telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasies, radiosensitivity and increased risk of cancer. Immunodeficiency is clinically heterogenous ranging from normal to profoundly reduced immune responses. There is both cellular and humoral impairment . Bloom&apos;s syndrome is an autosomal recessive DNA repair defect associated with immunodeficiency, sun sensitivity and predisposition to cancer. Respiratory infections are the main manifestation of immunodeficiency. Xeroderma pigmentosum is another rare disease with predisposition to cutaneous malignancy and increased radiosensitivity. Immunodeficiency has been reported in some but not all the patients with Xeroderma pigmentosum . Fanconi anemia is a rare X-linked disease characterized by increased sensitivity to DNA damage, bone marrow failure, somatic abnormalities and predisposition to cancer particularly acute myeloid leukemia and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Recently, Myers et al. showed quantitative and functional defects in the immune system of Fanconi anemia patients demonstrating deficit in NK cells, decreased B cells and abnormal cytotoxic dysfunction .  Toxic side effects of chemotherapy such as FN and mucositis have a major influence on the success of treatment in children with cancer. Malignant disease itself and chemotherapy agents may lead to an impaired host defence to infection. Several clinical, microbiological and therapeutic factors may be related to the severity of FN attack , gastric , prostate , hepatocellular  and bladder  cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , glaucoma  and cataract . There are limited number of studies which investigated the association between DNA repair defect genes and chemotherapy/radiotherapy related toxicity with conflicting results. Chang-Claude et al. showed that  XRCC1  399Gln allele is protective against acute side effects of radiotherapy . Another study suggested that polymorphisms in the  SOD2 ,  XRCC1  and  XRCC3  genes are associated with the development of late radiation injury in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma . Wang et al. found an association between  XRCC1  polymorphisms and cisplatin related gastrointestinal toxicity in lung cancer patients . Yin et al. revealed that  XRCC1  399Gln may have a significant effect on the development of radiation pneumonitis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy . Li et al. could not demonstrate any association between chemotherapy related toxicity in non-small cell lung cancer cases and  XRCC1  specifically codon 399 and  XPD  codon 751  Investigated toxicities were hematological (cytopenias), hepatic and gastrointestinal. Recently, a trial cohort of esophagial adenocarcinoma patients showed that  XRCC1  399Gln may be associated with resistance to radiochemotherapy .  The clinical presentation and cytogenetic characteristics of ALL and NHL with the same cell type (B or T) are very similar, however, both pathologies are still considered to represent two different disease entities. Previous studies suggested that ALL derive from a cell progenitor of the bone marrow, while blasts of lymphoma are more mature. We previously showed the differences between pre-B cell ALL and BL in relation to DNA damage repair gene polymorphisms . Considering possible roles of different DNA repair defect polymorphisms in the etiology of children with these two malignancies, we thought that a heterogenous group of patients with leukemia and lymphoma would be a better study group. Also these two groups of patients are treated with similar BFM based therapies in our unit. However, we must acknowledge a number of limitations in our study. First, it was not possible to analyze our results excluding other confounding factors for severe FN and mucositis such as late referral, timing of treatment, high dose chemotherapy and use of colony stimulating factors. Second this is a retrospective study, and we were not able to evaluate the patients who were lost due to FN, these patients could have been a positive control group if we had the chance to seek the mutations in their DNA materials.  In conclusion DNA repair mechanisms may have a role on neutropenic infections and mucositis in children with cancer. Our knowledge of immunodeficiency associated with DNA repair defects is still limited. Further studies of the association between DNA repair defects and infection in individuals with cancer may also shed insight to the rare DNA-repair defective syndromes and immunodeficiencies.
