<body>   1  Introduction  In adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, febrile neutropenia (FN) is associated with considerable morbidity and in-hospital mortality of up to 10%, the risk of which increases substantially in the presence of comorbidities , the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) , the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO)  recommend primary prophylaxis (PP) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for all cancer patients at ≥20% overall risk of FN during chemotherapy. Guidelines such as these are becoming widely accepted in clinical practice , and their introduction has meant an increase in the number of patients who qualify for primary prophylaxis, with the lower threshold for use, increased recognition of patient factors that contribute to FN, and the increasing use of dose-dense chemotherapy regimens .  One patient group at particular risk of FN is the elderly. Older patients with breast cancer may be substantially more likely to experience haematological toxicity compared with younger individuals . The EORTC  and German oncology association  have issued guidelines relating specifically to the use of G-CSF in elderly patients, noting that G-CSF can reduce the incidence of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in this population. It is therefore recommended that older patients are given optimal chemotherapy, with appropriate growth factor support, to provide the best chance of cure/remission or, in those with more advanced cancer, effective prolongation of life . CP neutropenia management was defined as no G-CSF, or daily filgrastim and/or pegfilgrastim in any cycle. Overall, the odds for experiencing FN were significantly lower with PP pegfilgrastim than with CP neutropenia management over all cycles ( P  &amp;lt; 0.0001) and in cycle 1 ( P  &amp;lt; 0.0001). Here, we assess the incidence of FN and related complications in the subgroup of elderly breast cancer patients.    2  Methods   2.1  Study design  Full details of the NeuCuP analysis have been published previously . Commonly used breast cancer chemotherapy regimens with moderately high (15–19%) or high (≥20%) FN risk were identified by Medline literature search using search terms including taxoids, (pegylated) doxorubicin, adriamycin, epirubicin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil. When combined with the terms febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, leucopenia and infection, the Medline search produced 513 relevant articles. A review of data from a retrospective study by the Impact of Neutropenia in Chemotherapy European (INC-EU) study group provided further information on the FN risk associated with different regimens. Based on the literature review, several relevant chemotherapy regimens were identified: doxorubicin (A) 50–60 mg/m 2  or epirubicin (E) 75–100 mg/m 2  + paclitaxel (T) 175–250 mg/m 2 , A(E) + docetaxel (Doc) 75–100 mg/m 2 , DocA(E) + cyclophosphamide (C), Doc monotherapy 100 mg/m 2 , A(E)C-Doc, A(E) + carboplatin (Cb) AUC 4–6, gemcitabine 750–1200 mg/m 2  + A 30–60 mg/m 2  (E 50–150 mg/m 2 )T, and vinorelbine 20–35 mg/m 2  + Cb. As vinorelbine + Cb and A(E) + Cb are not in common use, they were not included in the next stage of the analysis.  For the integrated analysis, we identified 19 eligible Phase II–IV clinical trials and observational studies (conducted between 1998 and 2005) from the original literature review and supplementary searches of the clinical trial database at Amgen (including investigator-led studies funded [in part] by Amgen) and abstracts from the ASCO annual meeting (2000–2005). All studies were required to involve the chemotherapy regimens noted above, with either PP pegfilgrastim (i.e. protocol-driven PP pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis from cycle 1) or CP neutropenia management. CP neutropenia management was defined as any approach in current use, including daily G-CSF in any cycle, pegfilgrastim in any cycle or no G-CSF use. The critical factor for inclusion of the study in the final analysis was ready access to data (including FN incidence) at the individual patient level. Eight studies were excluded due to lack of data access (details of these studies are given in the primary publication). Consequently, 11 studies were included in the integrated analysis ( ).  Descriptive summaries of demographic and disease characteristics were prepared for the individual studies and for the integrated populations of the PP pegfilgrastim and CP neutropenia management groups. G-CSF use was characterized by cycle in the PP pegfilgrastim and CP neutropenia management groups in terms of type of G-CSF received and number of days of daily G-CSF used. The characteristics of patient populations from individual studies within the PP pegfilgrastim and CP neutropenia management groups were compared, with the conclusion that there was sufficient homogeneity to justify their integration. Integrated patient and treatment data from the PP pegfilgrastim and CP neutropenia management groups were then compared at the descriptive level. This analysis focuses on the subgroup of patients aged ≥65 years ( ).    2.2  Outcome measures  The primary outcome measure was the incidence of FN over all cycles. Secondary outcome measures reported here include the incidence of FN in cycle 1, incidence of FN-related hospitalisation over all cycles and in cycle 1, incidence of dose delays &amp;gt;3 days and &amp;gt;7 days in one or more cycles, incidence of dose reductions ≥10 and ≥15% in one or more cycles, and haematological toxicity.    2.3  Statistical analysis  Descriptive statistics were generated for the integrated data from the subgroup of patients aged ≥65 years. All outcome measures were binary in nature. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated where appropriate.     3  Results   3.1  Patient disposition  Of 2282 patients included in the NeuCuP analysis, 285 patients were aged ≥65 years (PP pegfilgrastim,  n  = 181; CP,  n  = 104). In the PP pegfilgrastim group, 31 patients did not receive pegfilgrastim ‘per protocol’ from cycle 1, and were excluded from the final analysis. Of the 150 remaining patients in the PP pegfilgrastim group, 109 (73%) completed all planned cycles of chemotherapy, while 78/104 patients (75%) in the CP group completed all planned cycles.    3.2  Patient characteristics and chemotherapy  Baseline characteristics were generally similar between the PP pegfilgrastim and CP groups ( ). Doc monotherapy was the most common regimen in the PP pegfilgrastim and CP groups, followed by DocAC and ADoc. Most regimens were prescribed for a similar proportion of patients in the PP pegfilgrastim and CP groups, although ADoc was more frequent in patients receiving PP pegfilgrastim ().    3.3  G-CSF use  In the PP pegfilgrastim group, all patients received pegfilgrastim in all cycles except cycle 2, in which one patient did not receive pegfilgrastim. No patient in the PP pegfilgrastim group received daily G-CSF. In cycle 1, 73% of patients in the CP group received no G-CSF, as did 62% in cycle 6 ( ). Of patients in the CP group who received daily G-CSF, where number of doses was specified, five or seven doses per cycle were most common.    3.4  FN and related events  During chemotherapy, the incidence of FN was substantially lower with PP pegfilgrastim (6%; 95% CI: 2, 10%) than with CP neutropenia management (24%; 95% CI: 16, 32%), particularly in cycle 1 ( ). The lower incidence of FN in the PP pegfilgrastim group was accompanied by a lower incidence of FN-related hospitalisation in all cycles and in cycle 1 ( ).  The incidence of dose delays &amp;gt;3 days was numerically lower in patients receiving PP pegfilgrastim compared with CP neutropenia management (  ), but confidence intervals overlapped considerably. The incidences of dose reductions of ≥10 and ≥15% in the PP pegfilgrastim group were approximately half those in the CP neutropenia group (  ).    3.5  Haematological toxicities  Haematological toxicities (neutropenia, leucopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia) occurring during chemotherapy are shown in  . Overall, National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) grade 3–4 neutropenia and leucopenia were more common in patients receiving CP neutropenia management than in those receiving PP pegfilgrastim.     4  Discussion  In this descriptive subgroup analysis involving 254 elderly patients receiving chemotherapy with a moderately high to high FN risk, PP pegfilgrastim resulted in a lower overall incidence of FN and FN-related hospitalisations compared with CP neutropenia management. Furthermore, the incidence of FN was reduced in cycle 1 (3% with PP pegfilgrastim and 15% with CP neutropenia management). This is particularly noteworthy, as it has previously been shown that the incidence of FN is higher in cycle 1 than in any other cycle . Another recent study in elderly breast cancer patients evaluated the use of pegfilgrastim as primary or secondary prophylaxis to support the adjuvant dose-intense regimen FEC 100 , with results largely reflecting the findings of the present analysis . While overall neutropenic events (which encompassed grade 4 neutropenia, neutropenia with fever and infectious complications) did not differ between the different approaches to prophylaxis (PP, 80%; secondary prophylaxis, 72%), FN-related hospitalisation (0% vs. 17%) and actual FN reported as a serious adverse event (7% vs. 27%) were less frequent in the PP group. Moreover, a greater proportion of patients receiving pegfilgrastim PP received their chemotherapy cycles at planned dose on schedule (87%) than those receiving secondary prophylaxis (69%).  Apart from the relative difference in FN occurrence between the PP and CP cohorts, the absolute incidence of FN in elderly patients is of interest. It was higher in the CP cohort of the present analysis (24% overall and 15% in cycle 1) than in that of the overall NeuCuP study. This was perhaps expected, as elderly patients have previously been reported to be at increased risk of chemotherapy-related haemotoxicity compared with younger patients . This increased toxicity of chemotherapy in elderly patients may be related to a number of factors. Modified drug metabolism in the elderly may not be taken into account in the dosing of drugs . The impact of age on risk of haemotoxicity, however, remains controversial. A recent study in 976 patients aged ≥70 years showed no increase in the risk of haematological toxicity with old age  per se . It seems likely, therefore, that the actual risk of toxicity also depends on the patient population, pre-treatment with systemic therapies, comorbidities and other factors (many of which may be more common in elderly patients). For example, risk of haematological toxicity is also thought to increase with increasing disease stage . In another pooled analysis involving 1067 elderly patients receiving taxane-based chemotherapy, neutropenia grade III–IV occurred in 57.4% of patients, with febrile neutropenia in 6.92%, anaemia in 3.3% and thrombopenia in 5.0%, which are similar to the incidences reported in younger patients. Thus, elderly patients can tolerate taxanes with G-CSF support. Where clinically appropriate, such treatment should not be withheld.  The present analysis also highlights the low usage of G-CSF primary prophylaxis in the CP neutropenia management of elderly patients. As in the overall study population, G-CSF use varied widely, with around 60–70% of patients in any given cycle receiving no G-CSF. Of those that did receive G-CSF and for whom the type of G-CSF was specified, pegfilgrastim was generally more common than daily G-CSF, particularly in the later cycles. This variation in G-CSF use, particularly the low incidence of G-CSF prophylaxis, is typical and reflects the use of G-CSF in routine practice. This was demonstrated in a recent prospective study in community practice in the USA, in which 42% of patients were being treated for breast cancer, 24% had lung cancer, 14% colorectal cancer, 12% lymphoma (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 10%; Hodgkin's disease, 2%) and 8% ovarian cancer. Anthracyclines, platinum-based agents and taxanes were administered to 40, 31 and 30% of patients, respectively, with 80% of patients receiving two or more concomitant agents. Nevertheless, the overall rate of G-CSF primary prophylaxis was only 18%. In patients with Stages I–III breast cancer receiving a planned RDI ≥85% and G-CSF primary prophylaxis, the incidence of febrile or severe neutropenia in Cycles 1–3 was 21.3% (FN, 10.9%) compared with 53.6% (FN, 19.4%) in those not receiving primary prophylaxis.  Both reduction in FN risk and facilitation of chemotherapy delivery have the potential to translate into survival benefits. For example, a recent meta-analysis from Kuderer et al. demonstrates that G-CSF primary prophylaxis is associated with significantly less early and infection-related mortality in cancer patients compared with placebo or no treatment . Improved survival has also been demonstrated in breast cancer patients who receive full planned rather than suboptimal doses of adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g. RDI ≥ 85% vs. &amp;lt;85%) , but this must be balanced against toxicity to the patient.  Data from the current analysis represent a useful contribution to the literature concerning management of malignancies in elderly patients. The inclusion of 254 elderly patients represents a sizeable cohort for this relatively understudied patient population, but the sample size was not large enough to justify statistical modelling of data as performed for the complete dataset. All analyses are therefore descriptive and must be viewed in that context. Further studies focussing on cancer management in the elderly would be beneficial. For example, with reference to the current study, the effects of pegfilgrastim PP and CP neutropenia management on outcomes and survival in elderly patients remain to be explored. Furthermore, the proportion of patients aged ≥75 years was quite low in our population and more detailed studies in this particularly old patient group would be of use.  The trials included in this analysis are of varying design, while some arms from RCTs were excluded from the CP group due to protocol-driven use of G-CSF preventing their classification as ‘current practice’. These features can be viewed as a limitation in comparison with a traditional meta-analysis, but the inclusion of observational and retrospective data from different studies is a potential strength since they provide a better approximation of current practice than could be achieved in a randomized trial. Comparison of the available baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the two groups showed that the two groups were likely to be well balanced, but it should be noted that some data were lacking (e.g. in relation to performance status). Lastly, our analysis does not address the tolerability of the two different approaches to neutropenia management, however, previous authors have shown pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis to be as well tolerated as daily G-CSF .  In conclusion, these descriptive analyses in elderly breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with a moderately high to high FN risk, suggest that PP pegfilgrastim is associated with a lower overall incidence of FN compared with CP neutropenia management. PP pegfilgrastim also resulted in fewer dose reductions. Thus, these results, which are in agreement with evidence-based guidelines and other recent data, show that pegfilgrastim provided effective PP in elderly patients, who are particularly vulnerable to FN and its complications, potentially increasing the possibility of treatment with curative intent in this patient population. CP neutropenia management may not provide adequate protection against FN in elderly patients, which could place them at risk of increased morbidity and mortality.

<allsmall> Pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis vs. current practice neutropenia management in elderly breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy    Abstract   We investigated the incidences of febrile neutropenia (FN) and related complications in elderly (≥65 years) breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy supported by pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis (PP; n  = 150) or current practice (CP) neutropenia management ( n  = 104) in a subanalysis of NeuCuP (Neulasta ®  vs. current practice neutropenia management). Studies involving regimens with moderately high to high (≥15%) FN risk were identified by literature review, and individual patient data were integrated for analysis. FN incidence was 6% (95% CI: 2, 10%) in the PP group and 24% (95% CI: 16, 32%) in the CP group. In cycle 1, incidences were 3 and 15%, respectively. FN-related hospitalisation incidence was 5% (PP group) and 15% (CP group), while dose reductions (≥15%) occurred in 15 and 29% of patients. Pegfilgrastim provided effective PP in elderly patients, a population who may be vulnerable to chemotherapy-related FN and for whom current practice may not provide adequate protection.

Studies involving regimens with moderately high to high (&amp;gt; or =15%) FN risk were identified by literature review, and individual patient data were integrated for analysis. FN incidence was 6% (95% CI: 2, 10%) in the PP group and 24% (95% CI: 16, 32%) in the CP group. In cycle 1, incidences were 3 and 15%, respectively. FN-related hospitalisation incidence was 5% (PP group) and 15% (CP group), while dose reductions (&amp;gt;/=15%) occurred in 15 and 29% of patients.
