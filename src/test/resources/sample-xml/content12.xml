<body>   1  Introduction  An intact and functioning immune system is the single most important factor in defence against invading microbes. The very basic form of protection is provided by the innate immune response with the help of anatomic barriers such as an intact skin, and also specific cells and chemical moieties that are very efficient but non-specific. Cells such as neutrophils and macrophages are professional phagocytes that ingest and kill the microorganisms they encounter. Acquired immunity, on the other hand, leads to long-lasting memory of the pathogens and is coordinated by both the humoral and the cellular arm of the lymphocyte-mediated immune response.  Abnormalities of the various components of the body's defence system may have serious consequences. Ablation of progenitor cell lineages may lead to profound neutropenia that is so characteristic of cytotoxic therapy administered for various malignancies. Chemotherapeutic regimens not only lead to severe neutropenia that leave the host susceptible to various bacterial pathogens, they may also cause mucositis thereby providing a portal of entry for pathogens such as streptococci. Chemotherapeutic regimens vary in their ability to cause neutropenia. Severe neutropenia is an invariable outcome of ablative chemotherapy as part of bone marrow transplantation (BMT).  The risk of microbial infections is not uniformly distributed and varies with the time since cytotoxic therapy. In the case of BMT for example, this time period is classically divided into three phases. The pre-engraftment period lasts for 1–4 weeks following BMT. The post-engraftment period lasts from 4 to 12 weeks following BMT. The late period lasts from the end of the post-engraftment period to 1 year following BMT. The risk of bacteraemia is highest in the pre-engraftment period when severe neutropenia is most severe. The common bacterial causes of fever during this early period include staphylococci and streptococci among Gram-positive bacteria while Enterobacteriaceae (such as E. coli ,  Klebsiella  spp.,  Enterobacter  spp. and  Proteus ) and  Pseudomonas  are common Gram-negative bacteria encountered. Bacteria such as  Haemophilus influenzae  and  Streptococcus pneumoniae  can lead to infections during the late risk period. Others such as  Legionella ,  Nocardia  and  Mycobacteria  are rare but can be encountered over a wider range. Finally, multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), glycopeptide intermediate  S. aureus  (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Gram-negative bacilli that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) can lead to serious recalcitrant infections particularly in the immunocompromised host. Although it is difficult to accurately predict which patients would get infected with multidrug-resistant pathogens, certain predisposing factors include prior hospital admission, prolonged hospital stay, exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones, prior colonisation with multidrug-resistant organisms, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or diabetes mellitus, and presence of indwelling urinary catheters and central vascular access devices  ). Treatment of such infections remains a challenge. In the next few paragraphs, the established empirical regimens used to treat infections in patients with febrile neutropenia and the place of new antibiotics in an era of increasing drug resistance are discussed.    2  Empirical antibiotic therapy  Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections are common during the phase of neutropenia. The risk of Gram-positive infections has steadily increased (see below) due to widespread use of prophylactic antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin that are more active against Gram-negative bacteria. The commonest Gram-positive bacterial infections are caused by staphylococci and streptococci. Amongst Gram-negative infections,  E. coli  and  Klebsiella  are the commonest species encountered while the risk of infection with  Pseudomonas  species is low in the absence of common source outbreaks. In general, empirical cover for all Gram-positive organisms is not considered essential. Most empirical treatment regimens employ an effective Gram-negative cover, as sepsis due to such organisms can be rapidly fatal. An agent such as vancomycin can be added to the regimen if a  Staphylococcus  is isolated on culture. In absence of a response within 72–96 h, antifungal therapy is recommended .  It is important to bear in mind that empirical antibiotic therapy is only a guide. It often needs to be tailored to individual patients and should not be a substitute for definitive therapy once a cause is found and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolated organism is known. Unfortunately, this fact may not be appreciated and patients often remain on empirical treatment because of a general reluctance on the part of clinicians to switch treatment to less-popular, cheaper, but nevertheless equally effective older agents that isolates are susceptible to. Use of broad-spectrum agents leads to selection of organisms such as MRSA  and resistant coliforms . Also, a search for the source of infection is equally important and being aggressive towards removal of an offending source rather than aggressively using antibiotics can cure many infections. Many patients would become afebrile if, for example, a colonised line were to be removed. Line removal is most important for Gram-negative sepsis or that due to  S. aureus . Indeed, this often is a cure in itself for less-pathogenic organisms such as  Staphylococcus epidermidis . Importantly, non-infectious causes of fever should also be kept in mind. These include fever following transfusions, rejection response and adverse effects of various drugs .  Choice of empirical antibiotic therapy for febrile neutropenia in bone marrow transplant recipients should take into account:   1.  Characteristics of the host.    2.  The spectrum of antibiotics.    3.  Toxicity of the antibiotics.    4.  Local prevalence of resistant organisms, such as MRSA or Gram-negative organisms such as  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  or those producing ESBL.    5.  Prior invasive isolates from the patient's samples.     Patients vary in their susceptibility and response to infection. Attempts have been made to stratify patients into low- or high-risk groups depending upon various clinical and laboratory parameters. Stratifying patients by risk group influences the choice, duration, dose and route of administration of empirical antibiotics. Santolaya et al.  evaluated the risk factors associated with invasive bacterial infections in children with febrile neutropenia suffering from cancer. Hypotension, relapse of leukaemia, chemotherapy within the last 7 days, C-reactive protein greater than 90 mg/L, and platelet count less than 50 000 /mm 3  were associated with a high risk of infection. The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer has developed a scoring system to establish the risk of infection. Scores have been attributed to various parameters that include burden of illness, hypotension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, solid tumour, history of fungal infection, dehydration, outpatient status and age of the patient. Patients scoring ≫21 are classified as having a low risk for infection. With the cut-off set at 21, low-risk patients were identified with a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 68% and a positive predictive value of 91% . Other factors associated with a low risk of infection include absolute neutrophil and monocyte count greater than 100/mm 3 , normal chest radiograph, normal liver and kidney function tests, duration of neutropenia less than 7 days, temperature less than 39 °C, evidence of bone marrow recovery, no neurological signs and no abdominal pain .  Selected patients with febrile neutropenia but with a low risk of infection may be considered for oral antibiotics in the hospital or even as outpatients. Mullen et al.  administered outpatient therapy with oral ciprofloxacin to patients who did not have certain risk factors, had reliable caretakers at home and who could easily be transferred to a hospital. Thirty-two of 40 patients on oral ciprofloxacin were successfully managed compared to 31 of 33 who received intravenous ceftazidime also on an outpatient basis. This difference was not statistically significant. Freifeld et al.  conducted a double-blind trial comparing intravenous ceftazidime with a combination of oral ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in low-risk patients and concluded that oral antibiotics were safe and effective. Others have also made similar observations in low-risk settings . Clearly, selected patients can be managed with oral antibiotics thereby facilitating early discharge from the hospital, improving the quality of life and saving cost.  Most of the information about empirical therapy comes from trials conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer International Antimicrobial Therapy Cooperative Group (EORTC-IATG) over several decades. Because of the improved understanding of infections in febrile neutropenia coupled with developments in the field of antimicrobials, there was a steady decline in the mortality rates in patients with febrile neutropenia from the 1970s to the mid-1990s. From 1995 to 2000 however, the decline in mortality rates has been accompanied by a decline in success rates. This might simply reflect a protocol-driven change in therapy in absence of a rapid response. It should be kept in mind that in the presence of neutropenia, antibiotics may take some time before a response is seen. On the other hand, increasing resistance to quinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems may be the reason for more treatment failures especially in those receiving monotherapy. In the following paragraphs, we attempt to describe the merits of various approaches and the pitfalls associated with therapy.   2.1  Monotherapy or combination treatment?  In patients who need intravenous antibiotics, use of broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics such as cefotaxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem and meropenem has been the traditional choice for empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. Penicillin-allergic patients are usually treated with a quinolone or a combination of aztreonam and vancomycin. In general, there is little to choose between the several β-lactam agents with anti-pseudomonal cover and they compare favourably with each other. The decision to use a particular agent should be guided by local antibiotic susceptibility data. In some circumstances, combination of quinolones and β-lactams has also been used though the benefits of this combination are uncertain due to their overlapping microbiology spectrum.  Piperacillin/tazobactam in combination with an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin or tobramycin has been extensively used as an empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. Kelsey et al.  found an overall response rate of 67% with this combination. Laszlo et al.  compared netilmicin in combination with either imipenem/cilastatin or ceftazidime as empirical therapy of febrile neutropenia in bone marrow transplant recipients. A total of 69 episodes of febrile neutropenia were randomised and the response rate for both groups was similar (80% and 73% for netilmicin/imipenem/cilastatin or netilmicin/ceftazidime, respectively). de la Camara et al.  evaluated the efficacy of meropenem comparing it with a combination of ceftazidime and amikacin in febrile neutropenic patients. Their results suggested that monotherapy with meropenem was well tolerated and equally effective. Peacock et al.  evaluated a combination of ciprofloxacin and piperacillin in an attempt to find an effective aminoglycoside-sparing combination that could be safely used in cancer patients. The study group consisted of patients who were neutropenic (neutrophils count less than 1 × 10 9 /L) with a temperature of at least 38 °C. They were randomised into two groups with one group receiving conventional combination treatment (piperacillin/tobramycin) while the other received piperacillin with ciprofloxacin. The primary end point was successful treatment of infection and success was defined as normal body temperature on 4 consecutive days, eradication of isolated organisms from blood or local site, resolution of clinical signs of infection with no change in antibiotic treatment necessary during the period of empirical therapy. Survival during the neutropenic period was one of the secondary endpoints. Overall success rate of both regimens was similar and survival rate during the period of neutropenia was also comparable (96.2% for ciprofloxacin/piperacillin and 94.1% for the piperacillin/tobramycin group). Patients in the ciprofloxacin group became afebrile earlier than those in the piperacillin/tobramycin group.  Most haematology units in the United Kingdom use a β-lactam antibiotic in combination with an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin . The efficacy of combination therapy has been debated and a recent meta-analysis casts doubt over the benefits of combinations as opposed to the use of β-lactam agents alone. Paul et al.  compared β-lactam monotherapy with β-lactam/aminoglycoside combination therapy reviewing a total of 47 clinical trials enroling more than 7000 patients. There was no difference in patient outcome in the trials that compared the same β-lactam antibiotic with or without the aminoglycoside while data favoured the use of monotherapy when different β-lactam antibiotics with the same spectrum of microbiological cover were compared. There were also no differences in the rate of bacterial superinfections between the two groups. On the other hand, renal failure was more common in the combination arm and discontinuation of antibiotics due to adverse effects was also more common in patients receiving combination treatment. While combining a β-lactam antibiotic with gentamicin can be synergistic in many circumstances, it also adds to a significant risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity due to the aminoglycoside. Importantly, many such patients will already have a compromised renal function due to cytotoxic drugs that are administered as part of the prior conditioning therapy. Studies subsequent to this meta-analysis have also confirmed the usefulness of β-lactam monotherapy . This systematic review has been criticised on the grounds that several studies included in the analysis were from a period prior to the emergence of bacteria-producing ESBL that make them resistant to ceftazidime .  Despite lack of evidence of its use in terms of patient outcome, it is possible nevertheless that use of combination therapy decreases the chances of emerging resistance. Broad-spectrum monotherapy could also have an effect on the intestinal flora and could also lead to selection of organisms that are constitutively resistant (such as emergence of  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  or  Enterococcus faecalis  following carbapenem use or fungal infections following long-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotics). Also, the traditional fractional gentamicin dosing is now increasingly being replaced by safer once-a-day administration that is much less nephrotoxic. Finally, β-lactam/aminoglycoside empirical combination might be the best option in an era of emerging infections with MRSA and with organisms producing ESBL. There is evidence to show that patients with  P. aeruginosa  bacteraemia have a better outcome on combination therapy .  Notwithstanding the above arguments, attempts should be made to identify patients who are likely to do well on a single antibiotic and those who would benefit from combination therapy without suffering its adverse effects. Quite clearly, much more work needs to be done before a consensus is reached and it is important to weigh the relative risks and benefits of monotherapy and combination therapy and understand the variables that have had an influence on the literature and may have a role to play when choosing one over another ( ). It is perhaps far more important to switch from empirical therapy to pathogen-directed therapy once the organism is identified and susceptibilities ascertained. This needs to be a coordinated effort between haematologists, microbiologists and specialist pharmacists.    2.2  Gram-positive infections  Due to the early and extensive use of empirical therapy for the management of Gram-negative bacterial infections, the incidence of Gram-positive infection has been generally increasing though some unpublished data show a reversal of this trend perhaps due to reduced use of quinolone prophylaxis as a consequence of increasing resistance. Gram-positive bacteria are isolated in 60–70% of infections with defined microbiology. Staphylococci commonly originate from central venous catheters while streptococci, which are a part of normal oral flora, gain access to the bloodstream following mucositis as a result of cytotoxic drugs. While bloodstream infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci are less severe, those with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus  (MSSA) or MRSA can have a fulminant course. In certain circumstances therefore, initial empirical therapy that includes vancomycin along with another agent that covers Gram-negative bacteria may be indicated. These could include patients with prior history of MRSA infection or colonisation or those with suspected line-related infection, presence of severe mucositis, or prior history of prophylactic quinolone use that may predispose for infection with viridans streptococci. Hypotension or septic shock indicates high risk of Gram-positive bacterial infections .  In most other circumstances, therapy directed towards Gram-positive organisms is instituted only if patients continue to be febrile after 3–5 days of initial therapy in association with symptoms and signs suggestive of untreated infection. In a randomised control trial comparing ceftazidime alone and in combination with vancomycin as initial therapy for febrile neutropenia, combination therapy showed no benefits over ceftazidime monotherapy and was in fact associated with adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity. Vancomycin was compared with placebo in patients receiving monotherapy with piperacillin/tazobactam and who failed to defervesce after 48–60 h. Fever resolved in 82 of 86 patients in the vancomycin group compared to 73 of 79 patients in the placebo group . A recent meta-analysis failed to demonstrate any evidence for the role of glycopeptides in the initial empirical regimen .  Vancomycin is the drug of choice if a decision to include Gram-positive specific cover is made and trough levels in serum should probably be at least 20 mg/L for fully susceptible organisms (minimum inhibitory concentration ≤0.5  mg/L). In cases of vascular catheter-related infections, use of vancomycin line locks can be considered. In recalcitrant cases, consideration should be given for removal of the line, especially if MRSA or MSSA is isolated from blood cultures. Teicoplanin is an alternative choice. However, the drug has high protein binding that may reduce its efficacy. It has been shown that patients treated with teicoplanin continue to have fever for a longer period than those treated with vancomycin . Teicoplanin may be a preferred choice if outpatient therapy is considered. It must be mentioned that less information is available regarding teicoplanin dosages and care must be taken to avoid sub-therapeutic dosing and to ensure that adequate serum concentrations are maintained. This will often require dosing well above the currently recommended guidelines (e.g. 12–15 mg/kg per day). Serum assays for teicoplanin levels are not widely available but trough levels in serum need to be measured to ensure therapeutic efficacy. Trough levels for teicoplanin probably should also be above 20 mg/L. Glycopeptide antibiotics have been evaluated and used in combination with third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams and quinolones. Kelsey et al.  compared the combination of piperacillin and gentamicin with vancomycin and aztreonam in patients with febrile neutropenia. The results in both groups were comparable.  Empirical use of glycopeptides should not be considered unless there are clear indications in an era of increasing GISA, vancomycin-resistant  S. aureus  (VRSA) and VRE. Treatment of VRE is a therapeutic challenge particularly if the strain is resistant to ampicillin. Colonisation with VRE can subsequently lead to infection particularly in immunocompromised patients .    2.3  New agents  Newer antibiotics have a potential role particularly in the treatment of infections due to VRE and resistant  S. aureus . Linezolid is available orally and can be used for treatment of VRE and also for outpatient therapy in selected cases of bacteraemia due to MRSA. It can however lead to pancytopenia. Daptomycin, a lipopeptide that is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria, can be useful for treatment of VRE , linezolid-resistant enterococci , and MRSA bacteraemia and soft tissue infection. However, resistant enterococcal strains may emerge during therapy with daptomycin . Dalbavancin is an attractive candidate for treatment of MRSA infections because of its long half-life, which allows a once-weekly administration . It is also active in vitro against most VRE strains that have vanB phenotype . Tigecycline belongs to a new class of antibiotics called glycylcycline. These compounds are related to tetracyclines. Tigecycline has a broad spectrum of activity against both tetracycline-susceptible and tetracycline-resistant bacteria. It is active against MRSA and VRE but it has reduced activity against  P. aeruginosa  and  Proteus mirabilis  and other organisms with efflux pumps. Ertapenem shares many features of meropenem but is not active against  Pseudomonas . Its once-daily dosing allows outpatient intravenous therapy in absence of  Pseudomonas  infection. Other new antibiotics that are in development include doripenem, ceftobiprole and iclaprim. Doripenem is a carbapenem that is similar to meropenem in its antimicrobial spectrum but may have a lesser likelihood of selecting resistant mutants . Ceftobiprole is a novel cephalosporin that is active against MRSA on account of its affinity to PBP2′. Iclaprim is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor that has a mechanism of action similar to that of trimethoprim. It is bacteriostatic against MRSA and VRSA . Used wisely and effectively, these new antibiotics could form an important part of the armamentarium in the present and the future ( ).     3  Empirical antifungal therapy  Empirical antifungal therapy is usually administered to febrile neutropenic patients in whom fever persists despite antibiotics. However, there may be several other causes of persistent fever in patients with neutropenia. These include antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as VRE, viral infections, mycobacterial infections, fever related to underlying malignancy, fever due to various drugs, intravascular catheters , persistent bacterial infection due to inadequate antibiotic levels in serum, and infection related to biofilm on the catheter.  Bloodstream fungal infections occur in 5–14% of patients with haematological malignancies while autopsy studies identified fungal infections in 25% of leukaemia patients or transplant recipients . Guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend instituting empirical antifungal therapy in patients who remain febrile after 5 days of appropriate antibiotic treatment  although the decision should still be individualised depending upon the results of repeat examinations and investigations such as additional blood cultures and ultrasound and CT scans. According to the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Working Party of the German Society of Hematology and Oncology, modification of antibiotic therapy may be considered if fever does not settle within 72–96 h and addition of an antifungal agent is recommended in high-risk patients such as those with prolonged neutropenia . Consideration should be given to the use of antifungal agents in the initial empirical regimen in patients with a history of fungal infection.  If a decision to use empirical antifungal agents is made, various factors that need to be taken into account include:   A.  Toxicity of traditional antifungal agents such as amphotericin B.    B.  Availability of newer agents that are safer to use.    C.  Potential for selection of resistant fungal infections.    D.  Cost of antifungal treatment.      Candida  and  Aspergillus  account for a majority of fungal infections in neutropenic patients. Prolonged neutropenia is a risk factor for fungal infections. Infections with  Candida  are encountered during and after the second week of neutropenia while infections with  Aspergillus  occur during the third week and later . For serious established infections such as invasive aspergillosis, mortality approaches 100% in the absence of treatment and remains high even with adequate treatment. This has prompted early use of empirical antifungal agents in high-risk individuals.  Conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate, used at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg per day, has been extensively used as empirical treatment of persistent febrile neutropenia. Amphotericin B deoxycholate is a toxic agent and attempts to limit the toxicity of the molecule by using lipid formulations have proved successful without loss of efficacy, though with a substantial increase in cost. Three lipid-based formulations are currently available: liposomal amphotericin B, amphotericin B lipid complex and cholesterol-based amphotericin. It has been reported that continuous infusion of amphotericin B deoxycholate over 24 h instead of rapid infusion over 4 h is associated with significantly less toxicity and can hence prove to be a useful and cheaper alternative to lipid-based formulations . Low-dose amphotericin B lipid complex has also been found to be useful in neutropenic patients . Newer agents that have been used in the management of febrile neutropenia include voriconazole and caspofungin. Caspofungin has recently been licensed for empirical use in patients with febrile neutropenia. Breakthrough cryptococcal infection has been reported in immunocompromised hosts receiving caspofungin . Voriconazole, though not licensed for empirical use, is available orally and may prove to be an attractive choice in the future. Posaconazole, another new azole, has been found to be safe and tolerable at a dose of 400 mg bid in patients with febrile neutropenia . This study enrolled very few patients and hence the usefulness of posaconazole as an empirical choice could not be ascertained. There is no evidence for use of combination antifungal treatment even for proven diseases of fungal aetiology.  In a large trial conducted by the EORTC-IATG , neutropenic patients received either amphotericin B or no antifungal agent after 4 days of persistent fever despite antibiotics. The response rate was 69% in the amphotericin group and 53% in the control group ( P  = 0.09) based on the resolution of fever. One of 68 patients in the amphotericin group had documented fungal infection compared to six of 64 in the control group. The subgroup of patients who benefited most included those who had not received prior antifungal prophylaxis, those with severe neutropenia, those aged 15 years or more and those with documented infections. Although the data suggested the usefulness of amphotericin B in neutropenic patients with unremitting fever for greater than 4 days, no difference in mortality was observed between the two groups.  Walsh et al.  compared conventional amphotericin B with liposomal amphotericin B. The five primary endpoints defined in their study included: resolution of fever prior to recovery of neutrophil count, breakthrough fungal infections, deaths due to fungaemia, response to baseline infection and discontinuation due to side effects of antifungal agents. Clinical success, said to be achieved if all of the above five primary endpoints were satisfied, was not different between the two groups (49% for conventional amphotericin and 50% for liposomal amphotericin). Proven breakthrough fungal infections were observed less commonly in patients on liposomal amphotericin. Infusion-related toxicity and nephrotoxicity were significantly more common in patients receiving conventional treatment.  In a randomised double-blind trial involving more than 1000 patients with febrile neutropenia, Walsh et al.  compared the efficacy of caspofungin ( n  = 556) with liposomal amphotericin B ( n  = 539). The overall success rate was comparable in both groups (33.9% for caspofungin and 33.7% for liposomal amphotericin B). Caspofungin was however superior to liposomal amphotericin B in the subset analysis in terms of successful treatment in patients with proven baseline fungal infections and survival for 7 or more days after completion of therapy. Therapy was discontinued less often due to toxicity or lack of efficacy in patients receiving caspofungin. Not unexpectedly, adverse effects were observed significantly more often in the liposomal amphotericin B arm. Walsh et al.  also compared voriconazole with liposomal amphotericin B in patients with persistent febrile neutropenia. A total of 415 patients received voriconazole and 422 received liposomal amphotericin B. In this trial, voriconazole did not fulfil the criteria for non-inferiority but breakthrough fungal infections occurred less commonly in patients receiving voriconazole. Voriconazole was also less nephrotoxic than liposomal amphotericin B. A Cochrane database review concluded that liposomal amphotericin B was superior to voriconazole as an empirical choice in cancer patients with neutropenia . Even for proven or probable invasive aspergillosis in which voriconazole is considered superior to amphotericin B deoxycholate, there were significant differences in the duration of treatment (median duration of treatment with voriconazole was 77 days {range 2–84} compared to only 10 days {range 1–84} for amphotericin). Thus, although the newer agents appear promising, several important facts must be kept in mind when using these agents. While data that refer to the lack of toxicity of newer agents are very robust, there is less clear evidence in terms of efficacy because fungal infections in the setting of febrile neutropenia are not very frequently documented.  All the three randomised trials discussed above have several drawbacks. The endpoints in each of the trials were poorly defined. One of the reasons for using a ‘clinical success’-based definition and clinical endpoints is low incidence of documented fungal infection in neutropenic patients that make it harder to prove the superiority of one agent over another even with a large number of patients. It is interesting to revisit the study that compared voriconazole with amphotericin  in this context. While voriconazole did not meet the study criteria for non-inferiority based on clinical endpoints, the rate of documented invasive breakthrough fungal infections was less in the voriconazole group. Obviously, there may have been several causes of persistent fever in both groups unrelated to fungal infections. On the other hand, the study was probably not robust enough to compare outcomes of individual primary endpoints. It is also interesting to note that there was a wide variation in the success rate of liposomal amphotericin in trials that were quite similar otherwise . Bennett et al.  identified six major features that could influence the randomised trials for empirical antifungal therapy. These include: inclusion of low-risk patients, failure of blinding, modification of antibiotic therapy during the period of empirical antifungal use, failure to take into consideration those with prior antifungal prophylaxis, merging of safety and efficacy endpoints and differences in study criteria in terms of resolution of fever.  Clearly, there is a need for a set of guidelines that would identify patients who would benefit most from the use of empirical antifungal agents while avoiding the toxicity of these agents in a vast majority of patients who are currently treated unnecessarily. Drugs such as amphotericin B are highly nephrotoxic. Indeed, traditional wisdom suggests that in the absence of increases in blood urea and serum creatinine levels, it is likely that the patient is on sub-therapeutic dosages. Although the emergence of drug-resistant mutants is unusual other than in patients infected with HIV, breakthrough infections with resistant fungi have been reported in neutropenic patients receiving antifungal agents. In the trial that compared caspofungin with liposomal amphotericin B , breakthrough infections with  Aspergillus  and  Candida , were recorded in both groups while infection with zygomycetes, fusarium and  Trichosporon  species were seen in patients receiving caspofungin. Breakthrough infections with  Aspergillus ,  Candida  and zygomycetes have also been recorded in patients on empirical voriconazole . Also, potential interaction of antifungal agents with other drugs is a cause of concern. Voriconazole inhibits the metabolism of ciclosporin and careful monitoring and dose adjustment is necessary  and the dose of ciclosporin needs to be increased on discontinuation of voriconazole to avoid potential graft-versus-host response . Finally, the newer agents are expensive and this fact further emphasises the need to identify those who would clearly benefit from their use. Pharmacoeconomic analysis conducted at University of Colorado showed significantly high cost of liposomal amphotericin B ($10 248 for one course) compared to conventional amphotericin B ($126 for one course) . The estimated cost for intravenous antifungal therapy with newer agents such as voriconazole or caspofungin is around $200 per day .  It is equally important to be aggressive towards finding the aetiology of fungal infection. Current microbiological techniques are not very sensitive in identifying fungal infections especially in early stages. In future, molecular biology-based methods may help in the early identification of fungal infections and thereby help define robust criteria to identify those at risk. Finally, as in bacterial infections, every attempt should be made to find the aetiology in patients with unremitting fever. Repeat blood cultures should be undertaken and antigen detection tests for  Aspergillus  should be carried out where indicated. Antifungal susceptibility tests are available for  Candida  and therapy should be tailored based on the species identification and the result of the susceptibility tests. On resolution of neutropenia and if no fungal aetiology is identified, consideration should be given for early discontinuation of antifungal treatment especially if radiological investigations are normal. In patients who remain neutropenic but are clinically well, antifungal treatment should probably be discontinued after 2 weeks if chest roentgenogram and CT abdomen are normal .    4  Conclusions  Empirical treatment of infections in patients with febrile neutropenia has undergone several modifications in the past few years. As new agents become available in the market and as we become experienced in their use outside febrile neutropenia settings (such as daptomycin for endocarditis  or tigecycline for abdominal sepsis ), the range of choices offered by both antibiotics and antifungals is bound to affect the current policies and guidelines. Further studies will be required not only to firmly establish the roles for the newer agents but also to answer several questions regarding the existing agents. In an era of rising hospital costs and hospital-acquired infections, outpatient therapy with oral agents or agents with a long half-life appears attractive. While it is important to carry out studies to determine the efficacy of newer agents, it is equally important to keep in mind that older and cheaper agents can also be effective, provided the infecting organisms are sensitive to such agents.   </body>

<allsmall> Empirical antimicrobial treatment for chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia    Abstract   Febrile neutropenia in immunocompromised hosts is associated with a high mortality. Empirical treatment in such cases is instituted to cover the common pathogens. Generally, combination antibiotic treatment is used early in the febrile neutropenia phase. Recent studies demonstrate that monotherapy with certain β-lactam antibiotics can be equally effective. Glycopeptide antibiotics are used in the absence of an adequate response to the initial antibiotics. Empirical antifungal therapy may be given if fever does not settle in 72–96  h despite antibiotics. Newer antifungal agents have increased the available options for initial antifungal agents though more data are needed before any conclusive recommendation can be made. Recent changes in the epidemiology of multiresistant organisms necessitate local microbiological input into empiric policies with increasing need to consider cover for methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus , glycopeptide intermediate  S. aureus , vancomycin-resistant  S. aureus , vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Gram-negative bacilli that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases,  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , and multi-resistant  Acinetobacter baumanii .
