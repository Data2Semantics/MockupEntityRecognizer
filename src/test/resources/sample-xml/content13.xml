<body>   Objective:  The purpose of this study was to identify factors that increase the risk of neutropenic events in women with advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma who are receiving their initial course of chemotherapy following surgery.  This multicenter retrospective study comprised women with surgical FIGO stage III–IV epithelial ovarian cancer treated postoperatively with multi-agent intravenous chemotherapy between the years 1995 and 2008. Data were obtained from each institution&apos;s tumor registry and medical records. Outcomes were severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &amp;lt; 500/mm³) and febrile neutropenia (ANC &amp;lt;  1000/mm³ and temperature &amp;gt;  38.1 °C). Cumulative risk of neutropenic events was estimated by the product limit method of Kaplan and Meier. Multivariate analysis was based on the proportional hazard regression method of Cox.   Results:  Three hundred thirty-one patients met inclusion criteria. There were 142 severe neutropenic events and 22 febrile neutropenic events. In univariate analysis, significant predictors of severe neutropenia were a body surface area &amp;lt;  2.0 m² ( P  = 0.033), a body mass index &amp;lt;  30 kg/m² ( P  = 0.004), and white race ( P  = 0.003). Women who received chemotherapy on research protocols had significantly higher rates of severe neutropenia ( P  = 0.004) than those not on protocols. Patients for whom at least 85% of standard chemotherapy relative dose intensity (RDI) was planned experienced significantly more severe neutropenia than patients for whom &amp;lt;  85% RDI was planned ( P  = 0.035). Older women were more likely than younger women to develop febrile neutropenia ( P  = 0.05). In multivariate analysis, significant predictors of severe neutropenia were treatment on research protocols (HR = 1.86,  P  = 0.001), body mass index &amp;lt;  30 kg/m² (HR = 1.68,  P  = 0.041), white race (HR = 2.05,  P  = 0.015) and delivery of full-dose-intensity chemotherapy (HR = 1.66,  P  = 0.056). Predictors of febrile neutropenia were age &amp;gt;  60 (HR = 3.15,  P  = 0.031) and use of non-carboplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens (HR = 4.85,  P  = 0.002) (see table).   Conclusions:  Age, race, body mass index, chemotherapy regimen and planned dose intensity should be considered when making decisions about chemotherapy dosing and the use of bone marrow support factors intended to optimize each patient&apos;s cancer-related outcome.
