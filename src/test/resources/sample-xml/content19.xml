<body>   1  Introduction  The efficacy of oral fluconazole (FLZ) administration as prophylaxis against fungal infection has been established, but it has been reported that FLZ is not effective against all strains of  Aspergillus  spp. A previous report of the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group showed that the frequency of infection with  Candida  spp. has decreased, supposedly due to FLZ . In contrast, the frequency of  Aspergillus  spp. infection has increased , especially for patients with haematological malignancies. Invasive fungal infections such as invasive aspergillosis remain a cause of high mortality for patients with neutropenia during treatment for haematological malignancies or after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation , and administration of antifungal agents as prophylaxis for fungal infections remains the most promising treatment strategy.  Itraconazole (ITC) covers a broad antifungal spectrum, including  Aspergillus  spp., and is effective for tissue transition as well as being affordable . Moreover, the effectiveness of prophylaxis with ITC capsules (200 mg/day) has been reported for acute leukaemia and lymphomas  and is therefore at present thought to be the most suitable for prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia  . All patients had normal renal and hepatic function. ITC solution (once-daily dosing of 200 mg) was administered immediately before breakfast. Prophylactic treatment was initiated, in principle, on the first day of chemotherapy and was continued until the end of the neutropenic period (absolute neutrophil count &amp;gt;1000/μL) unless a systemic fungal infection was diagnosed or suspected. All treatment procedures were performed in a conventional room or in the outpatient clinic. The purpose, methods and potential adverse outcomes of this study were explained to each patient.    2.2  Concomitant medications  Use of systemic antifungal agents other than treatments used for this study was not allowed. Administration of drugs known to interact significantly with the antifungal effect of azoles, including pimozide, qunidine, bepridil, triazolam, simvastatin, azelnidipine, nisoldipine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine and vardenafil, was not permitted during the study.    2.3  Plasma ITC assay  Briefly, whole blood samples were collected in heparinised tubes. Within 1 h of collection, samples were centrifuged at 1700 ×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C. At least 1 mL of plasma was then transferred into polypropylene tubes and frozen at −70  °C until analysed for drug concentration. ITC and hydroxyl (OH)-ITC concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with a validated assay  at SRL Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan). The validated concentration ranges of this method were 3–500 ng/mL for ITC and 3–1000 ng/mL for OH-ITC. Mean recoveries were 59.7% for ITC and 72.8% for OH-ITC. Intraday and interday coefficients of variation were &amp;lt;4.6% and 5.0% for ITC, respectively, and 4.6% and 4.9% for OH-ITCZ at the different concentrations. The limit of quantification was 3  ng/mL for both ITC and OH-ITC.    2.4  Population PK analysis  A population PK analysis was performed with NONMEM software (version VI, level 1.0; Globomax LLC, Hanover, MD). The first-order approximation method was used to estimate the parameters. The drug concentration curve was approximated by using a linear one-compartment model with linear elimination, and an error model was selected as the exponential model. PK parameters for this model were clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vd) and absorption rate constant (Ka) (PREDPP subroutines ADVAN2, TRANS2). In addition, the following models were used to describe the interindividual variability in PK parameters. Error models to measure interindividual variability are represented by the following equations:     C   L  j   =  C   L   pop      e   η  j  CL    ,          V   d  j   =  V   d   pop      e   η  j  Vd    ,          K   a  j   =  K   a   pop      e   η  j  Ka    ,     where CL  j  , Vd  j   and Ka  j   represent parameters for the  j th individual, and CL pop , Vd pop  and Ka pop  represent population mean parameters, whilst  η   j CL ,  η   j Vd  and  η   j Ka  are independent random-error variables with mean values of zero and variances of  ω  2CL ,  ω  2Vd  and  ω  2Ka , respectively.  The residual variability was also represented by a proportional error model according to the following equation:     Cs   s   i  j    =  Č  s   s   i  j    (  1  +   ε   i  j    )  ,     where Css  ij   is the  i th measured steady-state serum concentration in the  j th patient, Čss   ij   is the corresponding predicted steady-state serum concentration and  ε   ij   is the residual variability term, representing independent identically distributed statistical error with a mean value of zero and variance of  δ  2  for serum concentrations.  A basic structural model with no covariance was fitted to the data with the POSTHOC option, which allows for Bayesian estimation of CL, Vd and Ka. Because of the small numbers of patients and blood samples, it was not possible to determine the covariates or to analyse including metabolites (OH-ITC).    2.5  Model validation  The accuracy and robustness of the model were evaluated by a bootstrap procedure, which was performed in an automated fashion using the bootstrap option in the software package Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN)  subjects; and comparative simulations of the dosing regimen (300 mg/day and 200 mg/day) based on the model parameters. A dosage of 5 mg/kg is recommended in Western countries  . The values for one patient were regarded as an outlier, as the concentrations were low and did not show a decrease over time; the samples were re-assayed but showed no change. Thus, 20 serum concentration data obtained from six subjects were used.  NONMEM analysis produced the following population PK data (%relative standard error of estimation): 12.7 L/h (6.74) for CL, 333 L (10.6) for Vd and 1.72 h −1  (57.0) for Ka.  The equations used for CL, Vd and Ka were:     CL  =  12.7   exp      (   η   CL    )   for clearance in L/h  ;          Vd  =  333   exp  (   η   Vd    )   for central volume of distribution in L  ;          Ka  =  1.72   exp      (   η   Ka    )   for absorption rate constant  (   h   −  1    )  ;          CL  j  =  12.7    e   0.00714    ;          Vd  j  =  333    e   30    ;     and     Ka  j  =  1.72    e   11.4    .       There were major differences between our data and the Australian findings for interindividual ( ω ) and residual variability ( δ ) ( ) .  This is because the larger the sample size (ours,  n  = 6, Australian,  n  = 49) and the sparser the data (Australian), the larger the variabilities are likely to be .     3.3  Bootstrap  From the original data set, 500 replicate data sets were generated and used for the evaluation of the stability of the model and the accuracy of parameter estimates.  lists the results of the bootstrap procedure, shown as median and 90% CI. The median values of the bootstrap procedure were comparable with the parameter estimates from the original data set, indicating that the accuracy and robustness of the model were acceptable. Because of the small sample size, we could not determine means, but used medians.    3.4  Simulations and predicted probability for trough concentrations &amp;gt;250  ng/mL  With bioavailability determined as 0.90, actual blood sampling concentrations were plotted on a simulation curve. Predicted probabilities for trough concentrations &amp;gt;250  ng/mL were 94.5% of patients receiving administration of 200 mg/day ITC solution once a day and 99.1% of patients receiving 300 mg/day (A ).  In our simulation, the AUC for twice-daily administration (100 mg × 2/day) was approximately the same as that for the 200 mg once-daily method (B). Compared with the Australian study, simulated drug concentrations in our study were very high (C).     4  Discussion  We determined the basic population PK parameters for ITC solution. Population PK parameters for patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis have been reported as 11.0 L/h, 212.0 L and 1.111 h −1  for CL, Vd and Ka, respectively . Whilst the difference in CL between the mentioned study and ours is small, Vd and Ka in our study are larger. These results suggest that there are differences in the drug distribution and absorption of ITC solution between infected patients with candidiasis and non-infected patients receiving prophylaxis.  Our simulated drug concentration curve is also three times as high as in the Australian study . This discrepancy may be due to differences in average body weight, drug disposition and response or polymorphism of metabolism enzymes between the Australian subjects (Caucasian,  n  = 47; others,  n  = 2) and our Japanese subjects ( n  = 6). It may also be due to the difference in drug metabolism between adults and paediatric patients since the mean age ± standard deviation of our six subjects was 65.3 ± 11.6 years whereas the median age of the Australian subjects was 8 years (range 0.4–30 years). With regard to bioavailability, our result is clearly different from that of the meta-analysis reported by Glasmacher et al. (0.90 vs. 0.55). These differences strongly suggest that population PK analysis of intended patients is essential for planning a prospective clinical trial.  Since 94.5% of our patients receiving 200 mg of ITC solution are predicted to maintain trough concentrations &amp;gt;250  ng/mL, our results show a rationale for administration of 200 mg/day for prophylaxis. However, because 99.1% of patients are predicted to maintain trough concentrations &amp;gt;250  ng/mL with administration of 300 mg/day, this dosage offers a more promising clinical outcome. On the other hand, adverse effects may be aggravated by 300 mg/day because the drug peak concentration is above that for 200 mg/day. Using the dosage of 5 mg/kg recommended in Western countries , so that the clinical outcome parameters of azole are believed to depend on the AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio. However, the target AUC/MIC of ITC remains unknown, because no animal experiments have yet been performed, but should be determined in the near future.  In conclusion, we constructed a basic PK model of ITC solution for Japanese haematological patients. Our pilot study has a limitation that the covariates affecting population PK parameters were not determined because of small samples. However, our preliminary study must be a leading one for establishing optimal administration of ITC solution as prophylaxis. Population PK parameters including covariates should be determined in the future.   Funding : No funding sources.   Competing interests : None declared.

<allsmall> Population pharmacokinetics of itraconazole solution used as prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia    Abstract   Although administration of antifungal agents, such as itraconazole (ITC) solution, for prophylaxis is the most promising strategy for the treatment of haematological malignancies, little is known about the population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. A clinical study was conducted to identify PK parameters for the administration of 200 mg/day ITC solution used as prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia in patients undergoing treatment. The study population comprised six patients. NONMEM software was used to estimate PK parameters. Clearance, volume of distribution and the absorption rate constant were 12.7 L/h, 333 L and 1.72 h −1 , respectively. These parameters were different from a previous study to large extent, which may be due to differences in intended patients. These differences strongly suggest that establishment of population pharmacokinetics is essential for planning a prospective clinical trial. Assuming a normal distribution, we predicted the trough concentrations of 94.5% of the patients receiving 200 mg/day ITC solution to be &amp;gt;250  ng/mL, indicating that administration of 200 mg/day might be suitable for prophylaxis. This pilot study presents a basic PK model of ITC solution in Japanese haematological patients for the establishment of optimal administration. Large-scale studies will be necessary in the future to determine population PK parameters with covariates.    Population pharmacokinetics, Itraconazole, Prophylaxis, Febrile neutropenia</allsmall>
