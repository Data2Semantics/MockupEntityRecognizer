<body>   1  Introduction  Antimicrobial therapy for chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia may consist of monotherapy with an antipseudomonal β-lactam antibiotic or combination therapy with a β-lactam and an aminoglycoside. A meta-analysis of 68 trials from 1983–2007 demonstrated a trend towards reduced mortality with monotherapy [relative risk (RR)  = 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75–1.02]. β-Lactam monotherapy was also associated with a decreased incidence of any nephrotoxicity in the six trials in the meta-analysis that used once-daily aminoglycoside dosing (RR  = 0.29; 95% CI 0.13–0.63). However, one study with an unusually high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was responsible for this effect. Furthermore, treatment failure was significantly more common in monotherapy trials that compared the same β-lactam agent (RR  = 1.11; 95% CI 1.02–1.21). The meta-analysis did not define renal impairment and the individual studies subjected to meta-analysis used variable definitions of AKI and did not differentiate between a transient rise in serum creatinine as opposed to long-term loss of renal function. The most common definitions of renal impairment used were any elevation of serum creatinine by &amp;gt;44  mmol/L and a doubling of serum creatinine. The meta-analysis found no significant increase in severe nephrotoxicity with combination therapy.  Since this meta-analysis was published, new classifications of AKI have emerged, including the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria . AKIN stage 1 corresponds to an increase in serum creatinine of ≥26.4  μmol/L or a 1.5–2.0-fold increase from baseline. The AKIN stage 2 criterion is an increase of 2–3-fold in serum creatinine, and the AKIN stage 3 criterion is a &amp;gt;3-fold increase in serum creatinine or an increase to &amp;gt;354 μmol/L with an acute increase of ≥44  μmol/L. These criteria have increased sensitivity compared with older definitions in the haematology/oncology literature.  The frequency of resistant Gram-negative organisms in the aetiology of hospital infections is increasing . It is therefore important to continue to study the optimal choice of empirical antibiotics for healthcare-associated infections.  The aim of this study was to ascertain the incidence and severity of AKI secondary to aminoglycoside use for febrile neutropenia at an adult tertiary referral hospital.    2  Methods  A retrospective study was conducted in Prince of Wales Hospital (Sydney, Australia), which is an adult tertiary referral hospital. Chemotherapy was administered for a variety of haematological and solid organ malignancies, including autologous, but not allogeneic, stem cell transplants. The protocol for antibiotic treatment of febrile neutropenia at the time of the study was intravenous cefepime 2 g twice daily in combination with gentamicin 3–5 mg/kg once daily.  As there was a single pathology provider to the hospital, all cases of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &amp;lt; 1.0 × 10  9 /L) from 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2007 were ascertained by a search of the pathology database. Medical records were then reviewed for all individuals admitted to hospital with neutropenia. Inclusion criteria were: neutropenia caused by chemotherapy for a solid organ or haematological malignancy (including autologous stem cell transplant); age &amp;gt;16 years; patient admitted to hospital; single temperature &amp;gt;38  °C by tympanic thermometer; and receipt of at least one dose of an aminoglycoside within 48 h of the onset of febrile neutropenia. Exclusion criteria were: aminoglycoside use for ≥48  h prior to the onset of febrile neutropenia; neutropenia from causes other than chemotherapy; and measurement of less than two serum creatinine levels ( ). More than one episode of febrile neutropenia could be included for a given patient.  Pre-existing chronic kidney disease was determined by calculation of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and was staged by the US Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) classification .  Transient renal impairment (TRI) was defined as any increase in serum creatinine concentration by &amp;gt;44  μmol/L within 30 days of the onset of febrile neutropenia. Persistent, significant renal impairment (PSRI) was defined as any of persistent increase in serum creatinine of &amp;gt;44  μmol/L at 30 days, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) or death from renal failure. A serum creatinine elevation of &amp;gt;44  μmol/L was used as this was consistent with other studies in the haematology and oncology literature  . In total, 148 episodes of chemotherapy-related febrile neutropenia treated with an aminoglycoside were identified in 108 patients. Gentamicin was used in 146 episodes and amikacin in 2 episodes. The median duration of aminoglycoside therapy was 5 days (range 1–35 days). The mean gentamicin dose was 3.2 mg/kg (range 0.7–5.6 mg/kg). The proportion of patients with baseline pre-existing renal impairment is shown in .  Seven episodes of febrile neutropenia (4.7%; 95% CI 2.3–9.4%) were associated with TRI of any cause; this included one episode for which the medical record was not available. Six episodes (4.1%; 95% CI 1.9–8.6%) were associated with PSRI, including one patient who received RRT and died from acute renal failure, and two other patients who died from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome including acute renal failure ( ). Five of the six patients with PSRI had one or more trough gentamicin levels measured (all &amp;lt;0.5  mg/L).  Two episodes (1.4%; 95% CI 0.2–5.3%) resulted in TRI with aminoglycoside therapy as the only or prominent cause. No PSRI episode (0%; 95% CI 0–3.2%) was primarily or only due to aminoglycoside therapy ().  There were a total of 31 (21%), 3 (2.0%) and 3 (2.0%) cases of stage 1, 2 and 3 AKI, respectively, using the more sensitive AKIN criteria. In the TRI group, there was one case of AKIN stage 1 and one case of AKIN stage 2 AKI attributable to aminoglycosides. There were two, one and three cases of stage 1, 2 and 3 AKI, respectively, in the PSRI group.  The mean variation between the baseline and maximum creatinine level for all episodes was +22 μmol/L (ratio 1.31), and the mean variation between baseline and Day 30 creatinine was +3.6 μmol/L (ratio 1.07). The mean variation between baseline and Day 30 eGFR was +9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 .  Medical records were unavailable for 26/554 (4.7%) of the cases of neutropenia of any cause. Searching of the pathology database for the patients with missing records demonstrated no episodes of PSRI, one episode of TRI (which was also a case of AKIN stage 3 AKI) and one other case of AKIN stage 1 AKI. All 26 missing episodes had at least two creatinine levels assessed. A sensitivity analysis was performed assuming that only the missing case with TRI met the inclusion criteria for febrile neutropenia, giving a proportion of TRI attributable to aminoglycosides of 3 in 149 cases (2.0%; 95% CI 0.5–6.2%), and assuming that all of the missing episodes met the inclusion criteria for febrile neutropenia and that the missing case of TRI was not attributable to aminoglycosides, giving a proportion of TRI attributable to aminoglycosides of 2 in 174 episodes (1.1%; 95% CI 0.2–4.5%) and a proportion of PSRI attributable to aminoglycosides of 0 in 174 cases (0%; 95% CI 0–2.7%). The sensitivity analysis shows that the missing medical records did not significantly alter the proportions of either TRI or PSRI attributable to aminoglycosides.    4  Discussion  It was demonstrated that the proportion of individuals who developed PSRI following aminoglycoside therapy for febrile neutropenia at this institution was low. The rate was similar to those in the studies included in the meta-analysis by Paul et al.  that used once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides  who found an unusually high incidence of renal toxicity. This outlying study accounted for the observation in the meta-analysis of increased renal toxicity where once-daily dosing was used.  The low proportion of episodes of febrile neutropenia resulting in PSRI in the present study may be related to therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and/or the relatively low mean gentamicin dose used (3.2 mg/kg/day). Once-daily administration of aminoglycosides may have contributed, although a meta-analysis of once-daily dosing in immunocompetent adults showed no significant reduction in nephrotoxicity compared with multiple daily doses (pooled risk ratio = 0.87; 95% CI 0.60–1.26).  Cooke et al.  treated febrile neutropenia with combination therapy including an aminoglycoside and found a low rate of renal failure, which they attributed to TDM and exclusion of patients at increased risk of nephrotoxicity (diagnosis of myeloma, nephrotoxic chemotherapy, age ≥80 years, previous gentamicin trough levels &amp;gt;2  mg/L and baseline serum creatinine &amp;gt;200  μmol/L).  Most other studies, including the meta-analysis , have either not defined renal failure or have used a single abnormal serum creatinine level as an endpoint for analysis. The use of the newer AKIN definitions of AKI demonstrated 24 additional episodes that resulted in AKIN stage 1 AKI compared with older definitions of AKI in the febrile neutropenia literature. We did not assess potential causes for these mild additional cases of AKIN stage 1 AKI. However, this finding suggests that milder AKIN stage 1 AKI may commonly occur in people with febrile neutropenia and future studies should use these updated definitions.  This study is limited by its retrospective design. Despite seeking multiple opinions and with detailed review of the case notes, attribution of the cause of renal impairment is more reliable prospectively. Renal biopsies were not performed. The main purpose of this study was to see whether the rates of AKI at this institution were similar to those previously reported in the literature and to confirm the outlying nature of date from Esteve et al. .  It was not possible to review some of the medical records. However, it is likely that every case of neutropenia at the hospital was detected and it was still possible to exclude renal impairment in all cases by interrogation of the pathology database. A sensitivity analysis was included which demonstrated that the missing medical records did not significantly impact the findings.  TRI (or AKIN stage 1 AKI) may still have long-term consequences for the patient, although the finding that the serum creatinine in these cases had returned to baseline is somewhat reassuring. We could not assess the potentially significant short-term consequences of transient AKI such as symptoms of uraemia, anxiety, length of stay, cost, or changes in other medications required.  All episodes of PSRI associated with the inclusion of an aminoglycoside in an antibiotic protocol for febrile neutropenia at this institution were associated with other causes of acute renal failure. Aminoglycoside therapy was associated with a low rate of TRI by older definitions, but may have been associated with a significant incidence of AKIN stage 1 AKI. The role of once-daily aminoglycosides as a low cost and reasonably safe addition to treatment in this setting should be revisited, particularly as the incidence of multiresistant, Gram-negative, hospital-acquired bacterial infections continues to increase.   </body>

<allsmall> Does aminoglycoside therapy cause significant acute kidney injury in febrile neutropenia?    Abstract   Owing to concern about aminoglycoside-related acute kidney injury (AKI) in therapy for febrile neutropenia, the aim of this study was to ascertain the incidence, severity and persistence of AKI secondary to aminoglycoside use for febrile neutropenia at an adult tertiary referral hospital. All admitted adults with neutropenia in a 27-month period were reviewed. Cases of febrile neutropenia due to chemotherapy who received an aminoglycoside were identified and renal function was assessed up to Day 30 after aminoglycoside administration. Transient renal impairment (TRI) was defined as any temporary rise in serum creatinine of &amp;gt;44  μmol/L within 30 days; and persistent, significant renal impairment (PSRI) was defined as an elevation of serum creatinine of &amp;gt;44  μmol/L at Day 30, or death from renal failure or need for dialysis. The Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) stage for all episodes was also determined. Amongst 554 episodes of neutropenia, 148 episodes of chemotherapy-related febrile neutropenia with aminoglycoside treatment were identified. PSRI occurred in six episodes [4.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9–8.6%] and TRI occurred in seven episodes (4.7%; 95% CI 2.3–9.4%). No PSRI was attributable to aminoglycoside therapy alone (0%; 95% CI 0–3.2%). Severe sepsis was the main cause of PSRI. Aminoglycoside therapy was the main contributing cause of TRI in two episodes (1.4%; 95% CI 0.2–5.3%). In conclusion, PSRI is a rare complication of aminoglycoside therapy for febrile neutropenia at this institution. AKIN stage 1 AKI is a common complication of febrile neutropenia episodes in which aminoglycosides are administered.    Neutropenia, Chemotherapy, Aminoglycosides, Acute kidney injury</allsmall>
