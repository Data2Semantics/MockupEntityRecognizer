<body>   1  Introduction  Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a relatively frequent event in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. It is a potentially life-threatening situation and requires prompt medical intervention. Despite improvements in long-term survival, infection remains a common complication of cancer therapy and accounts for the majority of chemotherapy-associated deaths, especially when the administration of appropriate antibiotics is delayed. Empirical treatment with antimicrobial agents without waiting for microbiological and/or clinical documentation of an infection is justified in patients with FN owing to the high frequency of severe infection that is associated with a low granulocyte count . There are a growing number of national guidelines, such as those issued by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in the USA as well as those issued in Latin America, Germany, Spain, Japan  ). Overall, combination therapy using an aminoglycoside plus either a cephalosporin, carbapenem or an antipseudomonal penicillin was used as empirical treatment by 64.3% of units. Ninety-five units (82.6%) used gentamicin as a single daily dose compared with 11 units (9.6%) using it twice or three times daily. The remaining 9 units (7.8%) did not use gentamicin. The frequency of prescribing antibiotic monotherapy in neutropenics is presented in .  A glycopeptide (teicoplanin or vancomycin) was routinely prescribed as part of initial empirical therapy by only 12 units (10.4%).   also shows the second-line antimicrobials prescribed to patients who did not respond 24–48 h after the start of initial empirical therapy. The most common approach was to add a glycopeptide to the ongoing regimen (51.3% of units), with teicoplanin being chosen approximately twice as often as vancomycin. Changing therapy to a glycopeptide plus a carbapenem was the other main approach (43.5%). Imipenem was chosen more often than meropenem.  The role of oral antibiotics in managing FN has been reviewed in this survey and only 34 units (29.6%) considered using oral antibiotics in this setting. Approximately 75.6% routinely used an oral quinolone (ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin) as prophylaxis in all neutropenic patients.  A total of 53 units (46.1%) used liposomal amphotericin as the antifungal of choice in treating persistent FN not responding to antibiotics followed by conventional amphotericin (28.7%) and fluconazole (20.9%). The remaining units used other antifungal agents (). Forty-seven units (40.9%) might consider adding an antifungal agent 5 days after failure of an antibiotic regimen to control the fever. However, 37 units (32.2%) might add antifungal agents after 3 days compared with 13 units (11.3%) that might add them after 7 days. The remaining 18 units had different views and answers.  Eleven surveyed units (9.6%) used prophylactic antifungal agents routinely. In all, 100 units (87%) used profound neutropenia as an indication for antifungal prophylaxis. The most common antifungal agent as part of regimens was fluconazole (87%), followed by itraconazole (11.3%) and voriconazole (1.7%).    4  Discussion  No previously published studies have examined the practice of managing FN in UK oncology units. This survey has shown that the most commonly used empirical first-line treatment in neutropenic patients with fever is piperacillin/tazobactam in combination with gentamicin. However, the proportion of units using this combination (50.4%) is less than that reported by haematology units (72%) when the same survey was carried out . This may be because oncology patients are generally less immunocompromised than patients with haematological malignancy. Recent meta-analyses have supported the use of antibiotic monotherapy in neutropenic fever . A further argument for combination therapy is that emergence of resistance is less likely. Routine addition of a glycopeptide such as vancomycin to empirical therapy in neutropenic fever was practiced in 10.4% of units. This figure was surprisingly high compared with 5% in haematology units (statistically significant) , where many more Hickman lines are used. A recent Cochrane review concluded that the addition of a glycopeptide prior to documentation of a Gram-positive infection does not improve outcome . However, IDSA guidelines on the management of FN in cancer patients recommend the inclusion of vancomycin in initial empirical therapy when Gram-positive infection is strongly suspected (i.e. an unstable patient with an infected intravenous line or extensive oral mucositis) .  A scoring system has been used to identify those patients with FN who are at low risk for complications, including mortality . A recent meta-analysis concluded that oral antibiotics may be safely offered to neutropenic patients with fever who are at low risk for mortality . Our survey showed that less than one-third of UK oncology units considered using oral antibiotic therapy in FN, despite the fact that many oncology patients might fall into the low-risk category. We might argue that very few patients in our survey received oral antibiotics for fever because they had already received oral prophylaxis. Further carefully designed studies are needed to specify the conditions under which outpatient therapy will be an acceptable, and perhaps the preferred, choice.  Fluoroquinolones are now widely used as prophylaxis for bacterial infections in neutropenic patients but this is a controversial area. We found that 75% of units used fluoroquinolone prophylaxis routinely in neutropenia. Their use has been shown to reduce the rate of Gram-negative bacteraemia and febrile episodes . In addition, fluoroquinolone use is likely to be at least partly responsible for the shift towards isolating predominantly Gram-positive pathogens in FN. Ciprofloxacin is known to be an independent risk factor for the acquisition of methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA)  and it is contributing to increasing levels of Gram-negative resistance. Evidence of a significant increase in fluoroquinolone-resistant  Escherichia coli  has been reported in Europe . Systemic fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality among oncology patients, although less than in haematological malignancy. Because of the relative insensitivity of diagnostic methods and the poor outcome associated with established fungal infections, empirical therapy is used for patients with FN who remain febrile despite administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Our survey showed that liposomal amphotericin was the antifungal agent of choice in 46.1% of oncology units. A large clinical trial showed that lipid formulations of amphotericin B are better tolerated and offer similar efficacy to amphotericin B . Currently, we expect that caspofungin may play an increasingly important role in this area following recent evidence showing it to be as effective as and generally better tolerated than liposomal amphotericin B when given as empirical antifungal therapy in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia . In terms of the timing of initiation of antifungal therapy, we found that 40.9% started after 5 days if there was no resolution of fever by this time; 32.2% of units favoured starting after 3 days, with 11.2% waiting until 7 days. All these approaches are valid, depending on the level of clinical suspicion in individual patients.  Fluconazole prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence both of superficial and invasive fungal infections and fungal-related deaths in neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia or autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) . However, a meta-analysis of 16 trials showed that prophylactic fluconazole was not effective in reducing fungal-related death or systemic fungal infections in non-BMT neutropenic patients . However, the IDSA does not recommend routine antifungal prophylaxis in neutropenia  and this is reflected in the fact that our survey showed &amp;lt;10% of oncology units used routine antifungal prophylaxis, mostly fluconazole. To conclude, this survey has shown wide variability in the antibiotics used in the empirical treatment of neutropenic fever in oncology patients. Units also differ over protocols for the modification of antibiotic regimens, antifungal therapy and the use of antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis. The development of UK guidelines with evidence-based advice could lead to standardisation of practice.   </body>

<allsmall> A survey of the management of neutropenic fever in oncology units in the UK    Abstract   A nationwide questionnaire-based survey was performed to define the different practices in managing febrile neutropenia in oncology units and the use of antimicrobial chemotherapy prophylaxis. A 69.7% response rate was obtained from a total of 165 units. Fifty percent of the responding oncologists used combination therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam plus gentamicin as a first-line treatment in febrile neutropenia. When response to initial empirical therapy does not occur after 24–48 h, 51.3% of oncology units add a glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) and 39.2% change to a carbapenem and a glycopeptide. The role of oral antibiotics in managing febrile neutropenia is still low. Approximately 30% of studied units might consider using an oral antibiotic in this setting. When response to initial empirical therapy does not occur after 3–7 days, 46.1% of oncologists preferred liposomal amphotericin to conventional amphotericin (28.7%) in treating persistent febrile neutropenia. The antimicrobial chemotherapy treatment of febrile neutropenia in oncology patients and the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis varies significantly across the UK. This survey is the first to examine the prescribing practices of UK oncology units in this area and could help in the formulation of practice guidelines.
