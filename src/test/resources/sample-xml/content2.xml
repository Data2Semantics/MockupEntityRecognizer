<body>  It was more than 40 years ago that the relationship between the circulating neutrophil count and the risk of pyogenic infection was established through the observations of Bodey and his colleagues. A relationship also exists between an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of &amp;lt;0.75 × 10  9 /L at day 5 of cytotoxic therapy and infection. the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Hematology and Oncology (DGHO), the Japan Febrile Neutropenia Study Group, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) all define a febrile state by a temperature that is clearly greater than the normal. The published normal body temperature based on oral thermometric measurement, is 36.8 ± 0.4°C ; the coexistence of oral cytotoxic therapy-induced mucositis tends to artificially raise this significantly (38.0 ± 0.2°C).  A single temperature measurement by mouth of 38.2°C associated with oral inflammation but with a normal core or tympanic membrane temperature should not be considered as due to infection without other evidence. Accordingly, an oral temperature ≥38.3°C (101°F) in a neutropenic patient (ANC &amp;lt;0.5 × 10 9 /L or ANC &amp;lt;1.0 × 10  9 /L but expected to fall to &amp;lt;0.5 × 10  9 /L over the next 48 hours), in the absence of obvious environmental causes, is by consensus usually considered to be a febrile neutropenic episode. It was not until the early 1960s when the first randomized clinical trial on empirical antibiotic therapy in leukemia patients permitted Curtin and Marshall to conclude that “in some patients, therapy must be started before bacteriological data become available.”  The most common cause of infection during that period was penicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus . The introduction of methicillin in the early 1960s was associated with a dramatic reduction in morbidity and mortality due to this microorganism. The principle of early administration of empirical antibacterial therapy did not become well accepted until Schimpff and colleagues from the National Cancer Institute published their observations on the importance of prompt initiation of broad-spectrum combination antibacterial therapy with carbenicillin and gentamicin for preventing resistance, broadening the spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria, and potential for synergy. Moreover, the seminal observations by this group describing the relationship between mucosal colonisation by healthcare facility-acquired bacterial pathogens and invasive infection in patients with acute myeloid leukemia has provided a foundation for our understanding of the pathogenesis of these infections and for the introduction of preventative strategies.  After the introduction of methicillin in the early 1960s, gram-negative bacilli such as  Escherichia coli  and  Klebsiella pneumoniae  became the predominant pathogens. Following the introduction of the first-generation cephalosporin, cephalothin, effective against these bacteria,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  emerged as a prominent pathogen associated with mortality rates of more than 75%, especially among patients who failed to recover myeloid function. The introduction of the first antipseudomonal carboxypenicillin, carbenicillin, had an important impact on survival for leukemia patients with  P aeruginosa  bacteremia. Compared to treatment with other monotherapies such as polymyxin or gentamicin, in which survivals of only 20% to 40% were observed, carbenicillin treatment was associated with survival rates greater than 75%. In the decades of the 1980s and 1990s, the spectrum of pathogens recovered in bloodstream infections among neutropenic patients shifted toward gram-positive organisms, notably coagulase-negative Staphylococci and viridans group Streptococci. vancomycin-resistant enterococci, penicillin-resistant  Streptococcus pneumoniae  and viridans group Streptococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and fluoroquinolone-resistant While opportunistic yeasts and molds are uncommon causes of first neutropenic fevers, invasive fungal infection (IFI) is being observed more commonly after chemotherapy day 14 among patients with prolonged marrow failure states such as those requiring sequential cycles of induction therapy or salvage therapy for resistant or relapsed disease.    Neutropenic Fever Syndromes  Neutropenic fever syndromes ()  have been classified as documented infection or as unexplained fevers. Documented infections are defined by the identification of an anatomically defined clinical site (for example, skin and soft tissue, upper and lower respiratory tract, upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, upper or lower genitourinary tract) with (microbiologically documented, bacteremic or non-bacteremic) or without (clinically documented) an associated pathogen. Unexplained neutropenic fevers are those associated with neither a pathogen nor a candidate infectious focus. The response rates to empirical antibacterial therapy for patients with unexplained fevers have been significantly higher than for those with documented infections. While it may be that some of the unexplained neutropenic fevers based on oral thermometry (particularly in the setting of oral inflammation) may not represent infections, the limitations of current diagnostic technologies do not permit a more effective way to discriminate between infectious versus non-infectious fevers.  A single neutropenic episode may be associated with one primary neutropenic fever syndrome (defined as microbiologically documented, clinically documented, or as unexplained fevers) the number and severity of which may largely depend on the duration of neutropenia.  Neutropenic fever syndromes that do not defervesce within 5 days after the institution of empirical antibacterial therapy have been termed “persistent neutropenic fever (PNF) syndromes” ( A).  PNF syndromes have been associated with an increased risk for invasive fungal infection. Neutropenic fever syndromes that develop after defervescence secondary to primary empirical antibacterial therapy are termed “recrudescent neutropenic fever (RNF) syndromes” ( B).  Diminished or absent characteristics of inflammation include induration, erythema, purulence or fluctuance, and local pain or tenderness. These features may result in lack of radiologic and clinical definition of pulmonary infiltrates, absence of cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis in meningitis, or urinary tract infection without pyuria or dysuria. Only 8% of the febrile episodes were unexplained fevers and the remaining infections were clinical infections. The clinical site most involved was the gastrointestinal tract in 43% of cases, of which the oral mucositis (70%), esophagitis (3%), enterocolitis (17%), and perirectal cellulitis (10%) comprised the major anatomic sites. Infections involving the skin and soft tissues occurred in 10% (venous access device-related infection 59%, cellulitis 35%, folliculitis 6%), pneumonias in 10%, and urinary tract in 6%. In another recent European trial of fluoroquinolone-based antibacterial chemoprophylaxis, unexplained fevers comprised 43%, clinical infections comprised 11%, bacteremias comprised 40%, and non-bacteremic microbiologically documented infections comprised 6% of febrile episodes, respectively, among placebo recipients. The difference in these two studies appears to be in the proportion of cases in which clinical foci were identified. In the American study there were significantly fewer unexplained fevers and more clinical infections, despite similar patient demographics to the European study. Not all investigators regard mucositis, oral or gastrointestinal, as clinical foci of infection despite clear linkages to infection risk and febrile events. Bucaneve et al reported a 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86%–93%) rate of pyrexial episodes among patients experiencing ≥7 days of severe neutropenia and who where not receiving antibacterial prophylaxis.    First Neutropenic Fever Syndrome  The onset of first neutropenic fever syndromes typically coincides with the neutrophil nadir and the maximal cytotoxic effect on the intestinal epithelial mucosa. recommends that such patients be admitted to hospital for an initial evaluation and rapid institution of empirical antibacterial therapy The workup should consist of a thorough history and physical examination, a complete blood cell count with differential leukocyte count, serum electrolytes with a serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, serum transaminases and total bilirubin, sets of blood cultures from more than one site (for example, a peripheral vein and multiple lumens of an indwelling central venous access device), and chest imaging if clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with a lower respiratory tract focus. Initial antibacterial monotherapy with an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam agent is recommended. In the setting of penicillin hypersensitivity, non–beta-lactam combinations (for example, ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin or aztreonam plus vancomycin) may be recommended. Glycopeptide antibacterial agents (vancomycin or teicoplanin) are not recommended as part of the first-line regimen unless there is evidence for methicillin-resistant gram-positive infection, hypotension, or pneumonia.  The first antibacterial regimen should be continued until resolution of the initial signs and symptoms leading to the diagnosis of neutropenic fever have resolved. For unexplained fevers that have resolved, the initial regimen should be continued for at least 4–5 afebrile days following defervescence if there is myeloid recovery. The duration of treatment for documented infection is dependent on the pathogen isolated, the site of infection, and myeloid recovery. In general, defervescence in febrile neutropenic acute leukemia patients occurs at a median of about 5 days.A). More than 25 years ago, investigators observed that between one quarter and one third of severely neutropenic cancer patients with persistent or recrudescent fever, despite receiving broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, may develop an invasive fungal infection. Moreover, in a series of studies the probable/proven IFI event rate has ranged from 2%–15%. Nevertheless, only breakthrough invasive fungal infections were reduced (odds ratio [OR] 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03–0.65; P  = .01), not defervescence (OR 2.91; 95% CI, 0.87–9.78; P  = .08) or overall survival (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 0.74–3.48; P  = .23), among patients enrolled in the original randomized-controlled studies comparing amphotericin B deoxycholate to untreated controls. challenge this widespread practice.    Recrudescent Neutropenic Fever Syndrome  This syndrome, defined in  and illustrated in B, may have a wider differential diagnosis than for the PNF syndrome and it appearance suggests that a new infectious process has developed, The event rate for this syndrome, which has been observed to occur at a median of 10 days after the institution of empiric antibacterial therapy for the first neutropenic fever, may be of the order of 15% (95% CI, 13%–18%). The EORTC-IATG observed unexplained RNF, clinical infections, and microbiologically documented infections (MDI) in approximately 30% of cases for each category, respectively. Among the MDIs, gram-positive organisms were isolated in 50%, gram-negative bacilli in 8%, and fungi in 42%, of which more than half represented IFI and two thirds of these were invasive mold infections. These observations suggest that for the majority of cases of RNF syndrome, the clinician must consider glycopeptide therapy for gram-positive infection and anti-fungal therapy with activity against  Aspergillus  spp. A thorough re-examination of the patient as for the PNF syndrome is indicated to discriminate infectious from non-infectious causes and bacterial from fungal pathogens etiologies.    Myeloid Reconstitution Syndrome  The temporal relationship between myeloid reconstitution after profound neutropenia and new onset or worsening of pre-existing pulmonary infiltrates in patients with possible, probable, or proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) has been erroneously interpreted as progression of the IPA syndrome. Subsequently, investigators argued that the pulmonary changes were due to the influx of transfused inflammatory cells to pre-existing sites of infection not previously discernable by roentgenography because of profound neutropenia. Moreover, Japanese investigators have observed possible links between hematopoietic growth factor–stimulated myeloid reconstitution and progressive pulmonary infiltrates among acute leukemia patients with probable IPA. The relationship between neutrophil recovery and the progressive histopathology of IPA has been described in animal models.  The myeloid reconstitution syndrome, similar to the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome described by Miceli et al in the context of IPA, may be more generally defined as new onset or worsening of clinically or radiologically appreciable foci, consistent with an inflammatory and/or infectious process, in temporal relationship to neutrophil recovery after aplasia. The syndrome may occur in the context of a persistent unexplained neutropenic fever syndrome or a RNF syndrome. Its recognition should compel the clinician to thoroughly investigate for evidence of superinfection, including bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. Myeloid reconstitution syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies in the differential diagnosis have been excluded. The likelihood of a superinfection must be considered in the context of the spectrum of coverage offered by the patient's existing antimicrobial regimen for the clinical site manifested by the myeloid reconstitution syndrome. For example, worsening of a perirectal focus with neutrophil recovery in a patient already receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy targeting enteric microflora may not require regimen modification. This approach may be re-enforced if the patient's neutropenic fever syndrome had previously defervesced or defervesced with myeloid reconstitution.    Conclusion  Recognition of these syndromes in the temporal context of the prolonged neutropenia profile in high-risk patients with acute leukemia can suggest the likely causes for the fever. Such information can help the physician make better clinical judgments not only about optimizing the available therapeutic options but also whether any new intervention is required.   </body>

<allsmall> Neutropenic Fever Syndromes in Patients Undergoing Cytotoxic Therapy for Acute Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes     Fever represents the major surrogate of infection in neutropenic cancer patients. A number of neutropenic fever syndromes have been recognized, the causes and significance of which will vary depending upon the clinical context. First neutropenic fever syndromes are typically of bacterial origin, the character of which may be influenced by whether antibacterial chemoprophylaxis has been administered. Persistent neutropenic fevers are documented during the empirical systemic antibacterial therapy for the first neutropenic fever, the cause of which is likely outside the spectrum of activity of the initial therapy. Recrudescent neutropenic fevers, defined by the appearance of a new fever after defervescence of the first fever, are often a function of invasive fungal infection or gram-positive infections outside the spectrum of the initial empirical antibacterial regimen. The myeloid reconstitution syndrome occurs in parallel with neutrophil recovery from aplasia and may not necessarily represent new infection. Recognition of these patterns can help the clinician make better clinical judgments and management plans.    </allsmall>
