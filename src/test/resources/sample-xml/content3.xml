<body>   1  Introduction  Febrile neutropenia is one of the most serious hematologic toxicities seen in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia is sometimes life-threatening, and immediate administration of empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotics is required. There are many guidelines for antibiotic therapy, including those issued by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in the USA. These guidelines are designed to optimize the management of febrile neutropenia . However, the mortality rate associated with febrile neutropenia is still high.  Not all patients with febrile neutropenia have the same risk and should be classified according to risk level . The MASCC model was developed mainly from patients with solid organ tumors, and its primary purpose was to identify low-risk patients with febrile neutropenia. However, the progression of infection is usually more rapid and critical in patients receiving treatment for hematologic disease than it is in patients with solid tumors. Therefore, it may be more valuable to identify the high-risk group among the febrile neutropenic patients, rather than to identify the low-risk group. Because of this special feature of patients with hematologic disease, a risk stratification model based only on patients with hematologic disease should be developed. However, there have been few attempts to derive a predictive model in this way.  For such a predictive model to be useful in clinical practice, clinicians must be able to check its components easily before febrile neutropenia develops. If a model is developed successfully, it will decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with chemotherapy and it will improve outcomes in high-risk patients through earlier, more intensive treatment. This study was designed to identify the prognostic factors of febrile neutropenia in patients with hematologic disease and to derive a risk stratification model from patients with hematologic disease only.    2  Materials and methods  We retrospectively analyzed 259 episodes of febrile neutropenia that occurred in 137 patients treated with chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation for their hematologic disease between January 2006 and July 2008 at the Korea University Medical Center, Anam Hospital. Patients who were eligible for this study included those who were diagnosed with acute or chronic leukemia, Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, or aplastic anemia.   shows the baseline characteristics of enrolled patients. Those who had not received chemotherapy were excluded from this study. Subsequent episodes of febrile neutropenia in the same patient were included as separate febrile neutropenia episodes.  Chest radiography, complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, AST, ALT, bilirubin, albumin, bicarbonate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), PT, and complete urinalysis were assessed prior to the implementation of chemotherapy and on the fifth day of chemotherapy. If a fever developed after chemotherapy, all patients were evaluated by physical examination, at least two blood cultures, urine culture and, if appropriate, cultures from other suspected body sites. Additional blood cultures were done if the patient's fever was sustained.  Patients with febrile neutropenia were immediately treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics following Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. If the fever persisted after 3 days of antibiotic therapy, glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin) against MRSA were added. The use of anti-fungal agents depended on the clinical course. All patients were given granulocyte colony stimulating factor according to indications. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korea University, Anam Hospital.   2.1  Definitions  Fever was defined as a single oral temperature of 38.3 °C (101 °C) or a temperature of 38.0 °C (100.4 °C) for 1 h. Neutropenia was defined as a neutrophil count of &amp;lt;500  cells/mm 3  or a neutrophil count of &amp;lt;1000  cells/mm 3  with a predicted decrease to &amp;lt;500  cells/mm 3 .  Febrile neutropenia episodes were classified into one of three groups: (1) microbiologically documented infection (MDI); (2) clinically documented infection without microbiological evidence (CDI) (defined as the presence of physical or radiological findings compatible with an underlying infection, including pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and sepsis syndrome, but without any microbiological evidence); and (3) fever of unknown origin (FUO) (without a clinically suspected site of infection or a microbiologically documented cause of infection).  ‘Serious complications’ was defined as hypotension (systolic blood pressure &amp;lt;90 mmHg), respiratory failure (arterial oxygen pressure &amp;lt;60  mmHg in room air or the need for mechanical ventilation), altered mental status, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmia, hepatic or renal failure requiring treatment, severe bleeding requiring transfusion, intensive care unit admission, and death. Patients were classified into either the “complicated group” or the “non-complicated group” according whether serious complications developed.    2.2  Evaluation of prognostic risk factors  The risk factors for serious complications of febrile neutropenia were investigated by comparing the non-complicated group with the complicated group. The following factors were assessed for their prognostic value in febrile neutropenia: age, sex, underlying disease, co-morbidities, location of fever onset (i.e., outpatient, general ward, etc.), time between neutropenia onset and fever onset, duration of fever, duration of neutropenia, severity of neutropenia, previous history of febrile neutropenic episode, recovery of neutropenia, and blood tests before chemotherapy and on the fifth day of chemotherapy. These blood tests included hemoglobin, WBC count, platelet count, BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, AST, ALT, bilirubin, albumin, bicarbonate, PT, ESR, and CRP. To estimate the response to antibiotic therapy, a follow-up CRP level was checked after five days of antibiotic therapy. We also determined the relationship between prognosis and the microbiological state, type of infection, culture result, and antibiotic and antifungal administration times.    2.3  Statistical analysis  Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 13.0. For univariate analysis, the chi square test or the Fisher exact test was used, and the odds ratio and level of significance were calculated. To determine the cutoff level of each variable, we used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of each variable versus the absence or presence of serious complications. The best point on the ROC curve, satisfying both the highest sensitivity and specificity for the presence of serious complications, was determined as the cutoff value of each variable. The variables significantly associated with prognosis of febrile neutropenia based on univariate analysis were further analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Statistical significance was assigned to two-sided  p  values less than 0.05.     3  Results   3.1  Patient characteristics  We evaluated 259 cases of febrile neutropenia occurring in 137 patients with hematologic disorders. Baseline characteristics are summarized in . The median patient age was 48 years (range 14–85 years), and the male to female ratio was 1.16:1 (139 male patients, 120 female patients). There were 141 cases (54.4%) of leukemia and 81 cases (31.3%) of lymphoma; other cases included multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and aplastic anemia. All patients were treated with chemotherapy, and some patients received stem cell transplantation. In the univariate analysis, age and underlying hematologic disease were significantly associated with serious complications ( p  = 0.001 and  p  = 0.010, respectively), but sex was not associated with serious complications ( p  = 0.077). Co-morbidities, such as hypertension and liver disease were significantly associated with serious complications of febrile neutropenia (OR = 2.443,  p  = 0.012, and OR = 2.825,  p  = 0.029, respectively). There was mortality in 61 cases (24%). The leading causes of death were septic shock with multiorgan failure (21 cases) and respiratory failure (9 cases). Only two patients died due to disease progression.  The median neutropenia duration was 17 days, and the median fever duration was 10 days. The median time lag with the onset of fever and neutropenia was 4.3 days. The fever onset time was classified as “early” or “late” in hospitalized patients based on a cutoff of 3 days after the onset of neutropenia. The development of fever outside the hospital was significantly associated with serious complications (OR  = 2.742,  p  = 0.003). In hospitalized patients, the late onset of fever showed a significant relationship with favorable outcome (OR 0.316,  p  &amp;lt; 0.0001). Fever duration and recovery from neutropenia were significantly associated with mortality. However, characteristics such as the neutrophil count at the onset of febrile neutropenia, duration of neutropenia, and history of neutropenia failed to show a significant relationship with serious complications.    3.2  Microbiological state  Of the 259 episodes, 95 (36.7%) were MDI, 57 (22%) were CDI, and 107 (41.3%) were FUO. The most common focus of infection was the respiratory tract (69 episodes, 26.6%), and second most common focus was a catheter (22 episodes, 8.5%) ( ).  Gram-negative bacteria were isolated in 50 episodes, with  Escherichia coli  being the most common. Gram-positive bacteria were isolated in 29 episodes, with  Staphylococcus aureus  being the most common. On univariate analysis, MDI cases were more associated with serious complications than cases with no isolated pathogen were. Respiratory tract infections, Gram-negative infections, fungal infections, and polymicrobial infections were significantly associated with mortality.  The most common initial antibiotic choice was cefepime, which was administered in 142 episodes (55%). If fever was sustained 3 days after the initial antibiotic treatment, a glycopeptide was added. If a fungal infection was suspected, an antifungal treatment was considered. The median time to the addition of a glycopeptide was similar between the complicated group and the non-complicated group (4.46 days and 4.20 days, respectively,  p  = 0.497), and there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the median time to the addition of antifungal agents (6.38 days and 6.37 days, respectively,  p  = 0.087) ( ).    3.3  Laboratory results  We evaluated blood tests just prior to chemotherapy as a predictive marker of serious complications and on the fifth day after the initiation of chemotherapy. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of serious complications was significantly associated with some blood test variables before chemotherapy. These variables included hemoglobin (&amp;lt; 8 g/dL), platelet count (&amp;lt;50,000/μL), BUN (≥20 mg/dL), creatinine (≥1.0 mg/dL), AST (≥40 IU/L), albumin (&amp;lt;3.3 g/dL), sodium (&amp;lt;135 mmol/L), ESR (≥20 mm/h), bicarbonate (&amp;lt;21 mmol/L), PT (≥14.4 s), and CRP (≥20 mg/L) ( ). High CRP on the fifth day after the commencement after antibiotic treatment (cutoff: ≥100  mg/L) was also significantly associated with serious complications. However, the neutrophil count and lymphocyte count before chemotherapy and on the fifth day of chemotherapy had no association with serious complications.    3.4  Multivariate analysis  Multivariate analysis was performed with the variables that showed statistical significance in the univariate analysis. These variables included age, underlying hematologic disease, co-morbidities, location of fever onset (i.e., outpatient, general ward, etc.), time of fever onset, recovery from neutropenia, infection type, respiratory infection status, and culture results. Significant pre-chemotherapy blood test results (e.g., hemoglobin, platelet count, BUN, creatinine, AST, albumin, ESR, bicarbonate, sodium, PT, CRP) were also included, as were CRP measurements obtained on the fifth day after antibiotic treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that independent prognostic factors included recovery from neutropenia, respiratory infection, baseline serum albumin, baseline bicarbonate, baseline CRP, and CRP on the fifth day after antibiotic treatment.   shows the results of multivariate analysis with the odds ratios (ORs) and their confidence intervals (95% C.I.s).    3.5  Derivation of risk stratification system  To predict the outcome of patients with febrile neutropenia as early as possible, we developed a predictive scoring model with factors selected through multivariate analysis. Among the prognostic factors determined through multivariate analysis, baseline serum albumin, serum bicarbonate, and CRP were easily detectable at the earliest time point and were measurable objectively. Therefore, we used these variables to construct a predictive model for prognosis. Our scoring model gave one point to each of the following factors: low pretreatment albumin level (&amp;lt;3.3 g/dL), low pretreatment bicarbonate (&amp;lt;21 mmol/L), and high pretreatment CRP (≥20 mg/L). The final score was obtained by summing the points (maximum total score of 3). This model was applied to the complicated group and the rate of serious complications was 100% in patients with a score of 3, while it was 6% in patients with a score of 0. The rate of serious complications increased according to the increase in score ( ).     4  Discussion  In this study, serious complications, including death, occurred in 72 cases (28%) and the mortality rate was 24%. Sepsis and respiratory failure were the most common causes of death. Respiratory tract infection was the most common site of infection (26.6%) and was a good predictor of poor outcome based on multivariate analysis (OR = 3.52,  p  = 0.024). These findings were consistent with previous studies . However, some recent studies have reported the reemergence of Gram-negative organisms as the predominant pathogen, which may be due to the increased use of more intensive chemotherapy regimens and the decreased use of quinolone prophylaxis . In this study, although the duration of neutropenia and neutrophil count did not differ significantly between complicated patients and non-complicated patients, recovery from neutropenia was shown to be the most significant factor for survival (OR = 17.31,  p  &amp;lt; 0.0001). Though neutrophil count and duration of neutropenia carry clinical significance, these variables are considered not to be universal predictive markers for predicting the prognosis of febrile neutropenia, based on our results.  In this study, a low level of pretreatment serum albumin (&amp;lt;3.3 g/dL) was a significant prognostic marker for serious complications in febrile neutropenia (OR = 4.027,  p  = 0.022). The pretreatment albumin level is the net result of numerous pathways involved in albumin synthesis and catabolism. It not only reflects the status of patients but also influences the status of patients. Because the serum albumin level reflects general nutritional status, low serum albumin was reported to be associated with mortality in patients with septicemia  which may increase the transcapillary escape rate of albumin and contribute to low pretreatment hypoalbuminemia. Chemotherapy-induced mucositis and nephrotoxicity can also cause loss of serum albumin and pretreatment hypoalbuminemia might reflect these toxicities . Moreover, the administration of antineoplastic agents results high oxidative stress . Because albumin is a significant antioxidant in blood and extracellular fluids , low pretreatment serum albumin level can increase the chemotherapy toxicities. Therefore, hypoalbuminemia can influence the function of normal tissues, including the immune system, during cytotoxic chemotherapy and increase susceptibility to serious complications of febrile neutropenia.  Metabolic acidosis in patients with severe infection correlated with poor prognosis in several studies . In patients with hematologic malignancies, lactic acidosis can occasionally develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome, which also reflected the poor prognosis . The current study showed that the low pretreatment serum bicarbonate level (&amp;lt;21 mmol/L) had significant prognostic value in patients with febrile neutropenia (OR = 3.344,  p  = 0.027). We could not accurately analyze the role of acidosis in this setting because we could determine the causes of acidosis in only a few sample patients due to an incomplete evaluation at that time. Because patients in this study had no respiratory co-morbidities (), most patients are considered to have a metabolic cause for low bicarbonate level. Metabolic acidosis might be related to some clinical features in patients under the active chemotherapy. First, high anion gap metabolic acidosis (e.g., lactic acidosis and uric acidosis) may be correlated with the burden of illness . However, it was the serum CRP level after fever onset that was investigated in those studies. In this study, the serum CRP level before chemotherapy, which was measured in afebrile state, was shown to have prognostic value in febrile neutropenia. Elevated baseline CRP was reported to have prognostic significance in various kinds of cancer . From this point of view, baseline CRP is considered to correlate with prognosis in febrile neutropenia, which is compatible with the results of this study. Moreover, there is evidence that inflammatory cytokines, including CRP, can influence hepatic metabolism of anticancer drug and reduce drug clearance in patients with cancer . Elevated pretreatment CRP was also suggested as a predictor of worse outcome after reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . Thus, high CRP may contribute to the toxicity of chemotherapy such as febrile neutropenia. The baseline CRP level is more practical than the febrile CRP level in identifying the high-risk group and implementing more intensive treatments at an earlier time. We investigated ESR, another inflammatory marker, as a predictive factor but could not find any prognostic significance. However, we consider that other inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα, may have a role in the outcome of febrile neutropenia and further study is required.  In cases of severe infection, rapid and intensive management is critical. There is a great need for efficient, early detection methods to identify high-risk febrile neutropenia patients. Although the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index is most frequently used to stratify patients, it is focused on the detection of low-risk febrile neutropenic cancer patients. No generally accepted predictive model for high-risk febrile neutropenic patients, especially with hematologic malignancies, has been developed. Therefore, identification of high-risk patients with hematologic disease could be more beneficial. We made a hypothesis that differences in medical health before chemotherapy contribute to outcome differences in patients with febrile neutropenia. Thus we focused on baseline blood tests which were objectively and easily checkable as the candidates of prognostic factors and constructed a scoring system using baseline albumin, bicarbonate, and CRP based on multivariate analysis (). Similar attempts have been made to stratify risk in patients with febrile neutropenia. Possible prognostic variables include the lymphocyte count on the fifth day of chemotherapy, the serum procalcitonin at the time of fever onset, and the baseline serum mannose-binding lectin level . However, in these previous studies, these parameters were measured after chemotherapy or fever onset and could not be easily checked in clinical practice. Moreover, these study populations were heterogeneous group, including both solid and hematologic malignancies. The current study looked at a relatively homogenous group which was composed of only patients with hematologic disease. The baseline serum albumin, bicarbonate, and CRP have another advantage in that they can be measured at relatively low cost.  A limitation of this study is that the data might not be independent because several episodes were assessed in the same patients (259 episodes in 137 patients). Therefore, the possibility of confounding factors cannot be fully excluded in multivariate analysis. This is a difficulty that is commonly encountered in retrospective studies. Thus, further prospective studies will be needed to verify the results of this study. However, this study may be the first report that suggests the possibility of prognosis prediction of febrile neutropenia by variables before chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the patients of hematologic diseases.

Based on multivariate analysis, significant prognostic factors are recovery of neutropenia, respiratory infection, baseline serum albumin, baseline bicarbonate, baseline CRP, and CRP on the fifth day after antibiotic treatment. From these variables, we derived a predictive model for the prognosis of febrile neutropenia using baseline serum albumin, bicarbonate, and CRP, which could be easily checked before chemotherapy.
